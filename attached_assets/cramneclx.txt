Introduction
Welcome to the NCLEX-RN®
Practice Questions Exam Cram
This book helps you get ready to take and pass the Licensure Exam for
Registered Nurses. This portion of the book discusses the NCLEX-RN®exam in general and how this Exam Cram can help you prepare for the test.It doesn’t matter whether this is the first time you’re going to take the examor whether you have taken it previously; this book gives you the necessaryinformation and techniques to obtain licensure.
The NCLEX-RN® Practice Questions Exam Cram helps you practice taking
questions that are written in the NCLEX® format. Used with the NCLEX-
RN® Exam Cram , it will help you understand and appreciate the subjects and
materials you need to pass. Both books are aimed at test preparation and
review. They do not teach you everything you need to know about the sub-ject of nursing. Instead, they present you with materials that you are likely toencounter on the exam. Using a simple approach, we help you understandthe “need to know” information. 
T o be able to pass the NCLEX®, you must understand how the exam is
developed. The NCLEX-RN® consists of questions from the cognitivelevels of knowledge, comprehension, application, and analysis. The majorityof questions are written at the application and analysis level. Questionsincorporate the five stages of the Nursing Process (assessment, diagnosis,planning, implementation, and evaluation) and the four categories of ClientNeeds. Client Needs are divided into subcategories that define the con-tent within each of the four major categories. These categories and subcate-gories are: 
A.Safe effective care: 8%–14%Management of care: 13%–19%Safety and infection control: 8%–14%00_0789737043_fm.qxd  10/31/07  11:53 AM  Page xv
B.Health promotion and maintenance: 6%–12%
C.Psychosocial integrity: 6%–12%
D.Physiological integrity
Basic care and comfort: 6%–12%Pharmacological and parenteral therapy: 13%–19%Reduction of risk: 13%–19%Physiological adaptation: 11%–17%
Taking the Computerized
Adaptive Test
Computer-adaptive testing, commonly known as CAT, offers the candidate
several advantages. The graduate can schedule the exam at a time that is con-venient for him or her. It’s also possible that you will not be tested on theentire 265-question range; if you answer the beginning questions correctly,the CAT might stop early in the session, with far fewer than the 265 ques-tions you were expecting. The first questions will be difficult and should geteasier. When the engine has determined your ability level and is satisfied thatyou are qualified to be a registered nurse, it will stop. The disadvantage of aCAT is that you cannot go back and change answers. When you make a deci-sion and move on, that’s it—no second guessing like on a paper exam. 
The Pearson Vue testing group is responsible for administering the exam.
You can locate a center nearest you by visiting www.pearsonvue.com.Because you might not be familiar with the Pearson Vue testing centers, werecommend that you arrive at least 30 minutes early. If you are late, you willnot be allowed to take the test. Bring two forms of identification with you,one of which must be a picture ID. Be sure that your form of identificationmatches your application. You will be photographed and fingerprinted uponentering the testing site, so don’t let this increase your stress. The allottedtime is 6 hours, and the candidate can receive results within approximately 7days (in some states, even sooner). Remember, the exam is written at approx-imately the tenth-grade reading level, so keep a good dictionary handy dur-ing your studies.Introduction xvi00_0789737043_fm.qxd  10/31/07  11:53 AM  Page xvi
Introduction xvii
The Cost of the Exam
A candidate wanting to write the licensure exam must fill out two applica-
tions, one to the National Council and one to the state where he or she wantsto be licensed. A separate fee must accompany each application. The feerequired by the National Council is $200. State licensing fees vary. Licensureapplications can be obtained at www.ncsbn.org. Several states are membersof the multistate licensure compact. This means that if you are issued a mul-tistate license, you pay only one fee. This information also can be obtainedby visiting the National Council’s website. 
How to Prepare for the Exam
Judicious use of this book and its sister book, the NCLEX-RN® Exam Cram ,
either alone or with a review seminar such as that provided by Rinehart andAssociates, will help you achieve your goal of becoming a registered nurse.As you review for the NCLEX® exam, we suggest that you find a locationwhere you can concentrate on the material each day. A minimum of 2 hoursper day for at least 2 weeks is suggested. In the NCLEX-RN® Exam Cram ,
we provide you with exam alerts, tips, notes, and sample questions, both mul-tiple choice and alternate items. Using both books allows you to practice tak-ing hundreds of questions much like those on the actual licensure exam. Wehave also formulated a “mock” exam with those difficult management anddelegation questions that you can score to determine your readiness to test.Pay particular attention to the helpful hints and the Cram Sheet. Using thesewill help you gain and retain knowledge, and will help reduce your stress asyou prepare to test. 00_0789737043_fm.qxd  10/31/07  11:53 AM  Page xvii
What You Will Find in This Book
As seems obvious from the title, this book is all about practice questions!
There are five full exams in this book, totaling 1,250 questions. Each chap-ter is set up with the questions and their possible answers first; the correctanswers and rationales appear at the end of each chapter. In the margins nextto each question, you will see a quick key to finding the location of its answerand rationales. Here’s exactly what you will find in the chapters:
.Practice Questions —These are the numerous questions that will help
you learn, drill, and review. 
.Quick Check Answers —When you have finished answering the ques-
tions, you can quickly grade your exam from this section. Only cor-rect answers are given here—no rationales are offered yet.
.Answers and Rationales —This section offers you the correct answers,
as well as further explanation about the content posed in that ques-tion. Use this information to learn why an answer is correct and toreinforce the content in your mind for exam day. 
You will also find a Cram Sheet at the beginning of this book specificallywritten for this exam. This is a very popular element that is also found inNCLEX_RN® Exam Cram (Que Publishing, ISBN 0-7897-3269-6). This
item condenses all the necessary facts found in this exam into one easy-to-handle tearcard. The Cram Sheet is something you can carry with you to theexam location and use as a last-second study aid. Be aware that you can’t takeit into the exam room, though.
Hints for Using This Book
We suggest that you score your exam by subtracting the missed items fromthe total and then dividing the total answered correctly by the total numberof questions. This gives you the percentage answered correctly. We also sug-gest that you achieve a score of at least 77% before you schedule your exam. 
If you do not, take the exam again until you do. The higher the score, the
better your chance to do well on the NCLEX® exam!Introduction xviii00_0789737043_fm.qxd  10/31/07  11:53 AM  Page xviii
Introduction xix
You should also take advantage of the CD exam engine; it provides you with
a computer-adaptive test, or CAT, very similar to the one you will experienceduring the NCLEX® exam. Every question in this book is on the CD,including the answer rationales. 
Aside from being a test-preparation book, this book is useful if you are
brushing up on your nursing knowledge. It is an excellent quick reference forthe licensed nurse.
Need Further Study?
If you are having a hard time correctly answering questions, be sure to seethe sister book to this one, the NCLEX-RN® Exam Cram (Que Publishing,
ISBN 0-7897-3269-6). If you still need further study, you might want to takean NCLEX® review seminar or look at one of the many other books avail-able at your local bookstore.

Practice Exam 1 and Rationales 55
Answers and Rationales
1. Answer B is correct. The client with passive-aggressive personality disorder often
has underlying hostility that is exhibited as acting-out behavior. Answers A, C, and D
are incorrect. Although these individuals might have a high IQ, it cannot be said thatthey have superior intelligence. They also do not necessarily have dependence on oth-ers or an inability to share feelings.
2. Answer A is correct. Clients with antisocial personality disorder must have limits set
on their behavior because they are artful in manipulating others. Answer B is not cor-rect because they do express feelings and remorse. Answers C and D are incorrectbecause it is unnecessary to minimize interactions with others or encourage them toact out rage more than they already do.
3. Answer C is correct. To prevent the client from inducing vomiting after eating, the
client should be observed for 1–2 hours after meals. Allowing privacy as stated inanswer A will only give the client time to vomit. Praising the client for eating all of ameal does not correct the psychological aspects of the disease; thus, answer B isincorrect. Encouraging the client to choose favorite foods might increase stress andthe chance of choosing foods that are low in calories and fats so D is not correct. 
4. Answer B is correct. The 4-year-old is more prone to accidental poisoning because
children at this age are much more mobile. Answers A, C, and D are incorrect becausethe 6-month-old is still too small to be extremely mobile, the 12-year-old has begun tounderstand risk, and the 13-year-old is also aware that injuries can occur and is lesslikely to become injured than the 4-year-old.
5. Answer B is correct. Parallel play is play that is demonstrated by two children playing
side by side but not together. The play in answers A and C is participative playbecause the children are playing together. The play in answer D is solitary playbecause the mother is not playing with Mary.
6. Answer B is correct. The first action that the nurse should take when beginning to
examine the infant is to listen to the heart and lungs. If the nurse elicits the Babinskireflex, palpates the abdomen, or looks in the child’s ear first, the child will begin to cryand it will be difficult to obtain an objective finding while listening to the heart andlungs. Therefore, answers A, C, and D are incorrect. 
7. Answer B is correct. A 2-year-old is expected only to use magical thinking, such as
believing that a toy bear is a real bear. Answers A, C, and D are not expected until thechild is much older. Abstract thinking, conservation of matter, and the ability to look atthings from the perspective of others are not skills for small children. 
8. Answer C is correct. Children at 24 months can verbalize their needs. Answers A and
B are incorrect because children at 24 months understand yes and no, but they do notunderstand the meaning of all words. Answer D is incorrect; asking “why?” comeslater in development.01_0789737043_ch01.qxd  10/29/07  3:48 PM  Page 55
56 Chapter 1
9. Answer D is correct. Urokinase is a thrombolytic used to destroy a clot following a
myocardial infraction. If the client exhibits overt signs of bleeding, the nurse should
stop the medication, call the doctor immediately, and prepare the antidote, which isAmicar. Answer B is not correct because simply stopping the urokinase is not enough.In answer A, vitamin K is not the antidote for urokinase, and reducing the urokinase,as stated in answer B, is not enough. 
10. Answer A is correct. The client taking calcium preparations will frequently develop
constipation. Answers B, C, and D do not apply.
11. Answer C is correct. C indicates a lack of understanding of the correct method of
administering heparin. A, B, and D indicate understanding and are, therefore, incorrectanswers.
12. Answer C is correct. If the finger cannot be used, the next best place to apply the
oxygen monitor is the earlobe. It can also be placed on the forehead, but the choicesin answers A, B, and D will not provide the needed readings. 
13. Answer A is correct. The client is exhibiting a widened pulse pressure, tachycardia,
and tachypnea. The next action after obtaining these vital signs is to notify the doctorfor additional orders. Rechecking the vital signs, as in answer B, is wasting time. Thedoctor may order arterial blood gases and an ECG.
14. Answer C is correct. The client with a femoral popliteal bypass graft should avoid
activities that can occlude the femoral artery graft. Sitting in the straight chair andwearing tight clothes are prohibited for this reason. Resting in a supine position, rest-ing in a recliner, or sleeping in right Sim’s are allowed, as stated in answers A, B, andD.
15. Answer A is correct. The best time to apply antithrombolytic stockings is in the
morning before rising. If the doctor orders them later in the day, the client shouldreturn to bed, wait 30 minutes, and apply the stockings. Answers B, C, and D areincorrect because there is likely to be more peripheral edema if the client is standingor has just taken a bath; before retiring in the evening is wrong because late in theevening, more peripheral edema will be present.
16. Answer C is correct. The client admitted 1 hour ago with shortness of breath should
be seen first because this client might require oxygen therapy. The client in answer Awith an oxygen saturation of 99% is stable. Answer B is incorrect because this clientwill have some inflammatory process after surgery, so a temperature of 100.2°F is notunusual. The client in answer D is stable and can be seen later.
17. Answer A is correct. The best roommate for the post-surgical client is the client with
hypothyroidism. This client is sleepy and has no infectious process. Answers B, C,and D are incorrect because the client with a diabetic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, or pneu-monia can transmit infection to the post-surgical client.
18. Answer C is correct. The client taking an anticoagulant should not take aspirin
because it will further increase bleeding. He should return to have a Protime drawn forbleeding time, report a rash, and use an electric razor. Therefore, answers A, B, and Dare incorrect. 01_0789737043_ch01.qxd  10/29/07  3:48 PM  Page 56
Practice Exam 1 and Rationales 57
19. Answer B is correct. Because the aorta is clamped during surgery, the blood supply
to the kidneys is impaired. This can result in renal damage. A urinary output of 20mL
is oliguria. In answer A, the pedal pulses that are thready and regular are within nor-mal limits. For answer C, it is desirable for the client’s blood pressure to be slightlylow after surgical repair of an aneurysm. The oxygen saturation of 97% in answer D iswithin normal limits and, therefore, incorrect.
20. Answer D is correct. When assisting the client with bowel and bladder training, the
least helpful factor is the sexual function. Dietary history, mobility, and fluid intake areimportant factors; these must be taken into consideration because they relate to con-stipation, urinary function, and the ability to use the urinal or bedpan. Therefore,answers A, B, and C are incorrect. 
21. Answer B is correct. To correctly measure the client for crutches, the nurse should
measure approximately 3 inches under the axilla. Answer A allows for too much dis-tance under the arm. The elbows should be flexed approximately 35°, not 10°, as stat-ed in answer C. The crutches should be approximately 6 inches from the side of thefoot, not 20 inches, as stated in answer D.
22. Answer C is correct. The temporal lobe is responsible for taste, smell, and hearing.
The occipital lobe is responsible for vision. The frontal lobe is responsible for judg-ment, foresight, and behavior. The parietal lobe is responsible for ideation, sensoryfunctions, and language. Therefore, answers A, B, and D are incorrect. 
23. Answer A is correct. Damage to the hypothalamus can result in an elevated tempera-
ture because this portion of the brain helps to regulate body temperature. Answers B,C, and D are incorrect because there is no data to support the possibility of an infec-tion, a cooling blanket might not be required, and the frontal lobe is not responsiblefor regulation of the body temperature.
24. Answer A is correct. A low-protein diet is required because protein breaks down into
nitrogenous waste and causes an increased workload on the kidneys. Answers B, C,and D are incorrect.
25. Answer B is correct. To safely administer heparin, the nurse should obtain an infu-
sion controller. Too rapid infusion of heparin can result in hemorrhage. Answers A, C,and D are incorrect. It is not necessary to have a buretrol, an infusion filter, or a three-way stop-cock. 
26. Answer A is correct. If the blood pressure cuff is too small, the result will be a blood
pressure that is a false elevation. Answers B, C, and D are incorrect. If the blood pres-sure cuff is too large, a false low will result. Answers C and D have basically the samemeaning. 
27. Answer B is correct. The child with nephotic syndrome will exhibit extreme edema.
Elevating the scrotum on a small pillow will help with the edema. Applying ice is con-traindicated; heat will increase the edema. Administering a diuretic might be ordered,but it will not directly help the scrotal edema. Therefore, answers A, C, and D areincorrect. 01_0789737043_ch01.qxd  10/29/07  3:48 PM  Page 57
58 Chapter 1
28. Answer A is correct. The elevated white blood cell count should be reported because
this indicates infection. A bruit will be heard if the client has an aneurysm, and a nega-
tive Babinski is normal in the adult, as are pupils that are equal and reactive to lightand accommodation; thus, answers B, C, and D are incorrect.
29. Answer A is correct. If the nurse cannot elicit the patella reflex (knee jerk), the client
should be asked to pull against the palms. This helps the client to relax the legs andmakes it easier to get an objective reading. Answers B, C, and D will not help with thetest.
30. Answer B is correct. If the doctor orders 0.4mgm IM and the drug is available in
0.8/1mL, the nurse should make the calculation: ?mL = 1mL / 0.8mgm; ×.4mg / 1 =
0.5m:. Answers A, C, and D are incorrect.
31. Answer B is correct. The pulmonary artery pressure will measure the pressure dur-
ing systole, diastole, and the mean pressure in the pulmonary artery. It will not meas-ure the pressure in the left ventricle, the pressure in the pulmonary veins, or the pres-sure in the right ventricle. Therefore, answers A, C, and D are incorrect. 
32. Answer A is correct. The normal central venous pressure is 5–10cm of water. A read-
ing of 2cm is low and should be reported. Answers B, C, and D indicate that the nursebelieves that the reading is too high and is incorrect.
33. Answer C is correct. The treatment for ventricular tachycardia is lidocaine. A precor-
dial thump is sometimes successful in slowing the rate, but this should be done onlyif a defibrillator is available. In answer A, atropine sulfate will speed the rate further; inanswer B, checking the potassium is indicated but is not the priority; and in answer D,defibrillation is used for pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.Also, defibrillation should begin at 200 joules and be increased to 360 joules.
34. Answer B is correct. The client should be asked to perform the Valsalva maneuver
while the chest tube is being removed. This prevents changes in pressure until anocclusive dressing can be applied. Answers A and C are not recommended, andsneezing is difficult to perform on command.
35. Answer D is correct. The potassium level of 2.5meq/L is extremely low. The normal
is 3.5–5.5meq/L. Lasix (furosemide) is a nonpotassium sparing diuretic, so answer Ais incorrect. The nurse cannot alter the doctor’s order, as stated in answer B, andanswer C will not help with this situation.
36. Answer A is correct. An occult blood test should be done periodically to detect any
intestinal bleeding on the client with Coumadin therapy. Answers B, C, and D are notdirectly related to the question.
37. Answer D is correct. After administering any subcutaneous anticoagulant, the nurse
should check the site for bleeding. Answers A and C are incorrect because aspiratingand massaging the site are not done. Checking the pulse is not necessary, as inanswer B.01_0789737043_ch01.qxd  10/29/07  3:48 PM  Page 58
Practice Exam 1 and Rationales 59
38. Answer C is correct. Acupuncture uses needles, and because HIV is transmitted by
blood and body fluids, the nurse should question this treatment. Answer A describes
acupressure, and answers B and D describe massage therapy with the use of oils. 
39. Answer B is correct. The fifth vital sign is pain. Nurses should assess and record
pain just as they would temperature, respirations, pulse, and blood pressure. AnswersA, C, and D are included in the charting but are not considered to be the fifth vital signand are, therefore, incorrect.
40. Answer A is correct. Narcan is the antidote for the opoid analgesics. Toradol (answer
B) is a nonopoid analgesic; aspirin (answer C) is an analgesic, anticoagulant, andantipyretic; and atropine (answer D) is an anticholengergic.

149. Answer C is correct. Lactulose is administered to the client with cirrhosis to lower
ammonia levels. Answers A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not have an effect
on the other lab values.
150. Answer B is correct. If the dialysate returns cloudy, infection might be present and
must be evaluated. Documenting the finding, as stated in answer A, as not enough;straining the urine, in answer C, is incorrect; and dialysate, in answer D, is not urineat all. However, the physician might order a white blood cell count.
151. Answer B is correct. The teenager with sternal bruising might be experiencing airway
and oxygenation problems and, thus, should be seen first. In answer A, the 10 yearold with lacerations has superficial bleeding.

nurse; in this case, that is the client 2 days post-thoracotomy. The clients in answersA and B are ready for discharge, and the client in answer C who had a splenectomy 3days ago is stable enough to be assigned to a PN.
155. Answer D is correct. The most suitable roommate for the client with gastric reaction
is the client with phlebitis because the client with phlebitis will not transmit any infec-tion to the surgical client.

charge nurse. Further action might be needed, but it will be done by the charge nurse.Answers A, C, and D are incorrect because notifying the police is overreacting at thistime, and monitoring or ignoring the situation is an inadequate response. 
163. Answer D is correct. The best client to assign to the newly licensed nurse is the most
stable client; in this case, it is the client with diverticulitis. The client receivingchemotherapy and the client with a coronary bypass both need nurses experienced inthese areas, so answers A and B are incorrect. Answer C is incorrect because theclient with a transurethral prostatectomy might bleed, so this client should beassigned to a nurse who knows how much bleeding is within normal limits.
164. Answer D is correct. Intrathecal medications are administered into the cerebrospinal
fluid. This method of administering medications is reserved for the client metastases,the client with chronic pain, or the client with cerebrospinal infections. Answers A, B,and C are incorrect because intravenous, rectal, and intramuscular injections areentirely different procedures. 
165. Answer B is correct. Montgomery straps are used to secure dressings that require
frequent dressing changes because the client with a cholecystectomy usually has alarge amount of draining on the dressing. Montgomery straps are also used for clientswho are allergic to several types of tape. This client is not at higher risk of eviscerationthan other clients, so answer A is incorrect. Montgomery straps are not used tosecure the drains, so answer C is incorrect. Sutures or clips are used to secure thewound of the client who has had gallbladder surgery, so answer D is incorrect.
166. Answer B is correct. The client with pancreatitis frequently has nausea and vomiting.
Lavage is often used to decompress the stomach and rest the bowel, so the insertionof a Levine tube should be anticipated. Answers A and C are incorrect because bloodpressures are not required every 15 minutes, and cardiac monitoring might be need-ed, but this is individualized to the client. Answer D is incorrect because there are nodressings to change on this client.01_0789737043_ch01.qxd  10/29/07  3:48 PM  Page 71

168. Answer A is correct. If the nurse is exposed to the client with a cough, the best item
to wear is a mask. If the answer had included a mask, gloves, and a gown, all wouldbe appropriate, but in this case, only one item is listed; therefore, answers B and C areincorrect. Shoe covers are not necessary, so answer D is incorrect. 
169. Answer D is correct. Abnormal grieving is exhibited by a lack of feeling sad; if the
client’s sister appears not to grieve, it might be abnormal grieving. She thinks theclient might be suppressing feelings of grief. Answers A, B, and C are all normalexpressions of grief and, therefore, incorrect.

175. Answer C is correct. If the client eviscerates, the abdominal content should be cov-
ered with a sterile saline-soaked dressing. Reinserting the content should not be theaction and will require that the client return to surgery; thus, answer A is incorrect.Answers B and D are incorrect because they not appropriate to this case. 
176. Answer B is correct. Cancer in situ means that the cancer is still localized to the pri-
mary site. 
Tstands for “tumor” and the ISfor “in situ.” Cancer is graded in terms of

ney ureters and urethra. Answer A is incorrect because there is no need to force fluids
before the test. Answer C is incorrect because there is no need to withhold medicationfor 12 hours before the test. Answer D is incorrect because the client’s reproductiveorgans should not be covered. 
178. Answer C is correct. The client with a fractured femur will be placed in Buck’s trac-
tion to realign the leg and to decrease spasms and pain. The Trendelenburg position isthe wrong position for this client, so answer A is incorrect.

An abduction pillow isordered after a total hip replacement, not for a fractured femur; therefore, answer D isincorrect.
179. Answer C is correct. A red, beefy tongue is characteristic of the client with pernicious
anemia. Answer A, a weight loss of 10 pounds in 2 weeks, is abnormal but is not seenin pernicious anemia. Numbness and tingling, in answer B, can be associated with ane-mia but are not particular to pernicious anemia. This is more likely associated withperipheral vascular diseases involving vasculature. In answer D, the hemoglobin is nor-mal and does not support the diagnosis. 
180. Answer B is correct. Portions of the exam are painful, especially when the sample is
being withdrawn, so this should be included in the session with the client. Answer A isincorrect because the client will be positioned prone, not in a sitting position, for theexam. Anesthesia is not commonly given before this test, making answer C incorrect.Answer D is incorrect because the client can eat and drink following the test.
181. Answer C is correct. The assessment that is most crucial to the client is the identifi-
cation of peripheral pulses because the aorta is clamped during surgery. This decreas-es blood circulation to the kidneys and lower extremities.

182. Answer A is correct. Suctioning can cause a vagal response, lowering the heart rate
and causing bradycardia. Answers B, C and D can occur as well, but they are less likely.
183. Answer C is correct. The client with an internal defibrillator should learn to use any
battery-operated machinery on the opposite side. He should also take his pulse rateand report dizziness or fainting. Answers A, B, and D are incorrect because the clientcan eat food prepared in the microwave, move his shoulder on the affected side, andfly in an airplane.
184. Answer A is correct. A swelling over the right parietal area is a cephalhematoma, an
area of bleeding outside the cranium. This type of hematoma does not cross thesuture line. Answer B, molding, is overlapping of the bones of the cranium and, thus,incorrect. In answer C, a subdural hematoma, or intracranial bleeding, is ominous andcan be seen only on a CAT scan or x-ray. A caput succedaneum, in answer D, crossesthe suture line and is edema. 01_0789737043_ch01.qxd  10/29/07  3:48 PM  Page 73

A high-fiber diet, in answer C, is not ordered at this time.
190. Answer C is correct. The client with diverticulitis should avoid foods with seeds. The
foods in answers A, B, and D are allowed; in fact, bran cereal and fruit will help pre-vent constipation.

Answers A, B, and D are useful in determining the extent of disease process and,thus, are incorrect.
192. Answer C is correct. Tegretol can suppress the bone marrow and decrease the white
blood cell count; thus, a lab value of WBC 2,000 per cubic millimeter indicates sideeffects of the drug. Answers A and D are within normal limits, and answer B is a lowerlimit of normal; therefore answers A, B, and D are incorrect.
193. Answer D is correct. Sarcoma is a type of bone cancer; therefore, bone pain would
be expected. Answers A, B, and C are not specific to this type of cancer and are incor-rect.
194. Answer D is correct. A birth weight of 7 pounds would indicate 21 pounds in 1 year,
or triple his birth weight. Answers A, B, and C therefore are incorrect.

Practice Exam 1 and Rationales 75
197. Answer B is correct. The client with burns to the neck needs airway assessment and
supplemental oxygen, so applying oxygen is the priority. The next action should be to
start an IV and medicate for pain, making answers A and C incorrect. Answer D,obtaining blood gases is of less priority. 
198. Answer A is correct. The primary responsibility of the nurse is to take the vital signs
before any surgery. The actions in answers B, C, and D are the responsibility of thedoctor and, therefore, are incorrect for this question.
199. Answer B is correct. The only lab result that is abnormal is the potassium. A potassi-
um level of 1.9 indicates hypokalemia. The findings in answers A, C, and D are notrevealed in the stem.

thus the need for altering nutritional needs. The problems in answers B, C, and D are oflesser concern and, thus, are incorrect in this instance.
202. Answer C is correct. Daily measuring of the abdominal girth is the best method of
determining early ascites. Measuring with a paper tape measure and marking themeasured area is the most objective method of estimating ascites. Inspection andchecking for fluid waves, in answers A and D, are more subjective and, thus, areincorrect for this question. Palpation of the liver, in answer B, will not tell the amountof ascites.
203. Answer B is correct. The vital signs indicate hypovolemic shock or fluid volume
deficit. In answers A, C, and D, cerebral tissue perfusion, airway clearance, and senso-ry perception alterations are not symptoms and, therefore, are incorrect.
204. Answer A is correct. The client with sickle cell is likely to experience symptoms of
hypoxia if he becomes dehydrated or lacks oxygen. Extreme exercise, especially inwarm weather, can exacerbate the condition, so the fact that the client plays baseballshould be of great concern to the visiting nurse. Answers B, C, and D are not factorsfor concern with sickle cell disease.
205. Answer D is correct. The client with neutropenia should not have potted or cut flow-
ers in the room. Cancer patients are extremely susceptible to bacterial infections.Answers A, B, and C will not help to prevent bacterial invasions and, therefore, areincorrect.
206. Answer B is correct. Clients who have not had surgery to the face or neck would
benefit from lowering the head of the bed, as in answer A. However, in this situationlowering the client’s head could further interfere with the airway.

208. Answer A is correct. An INR of 8 indicates that the blood is too thin. The normal INR
is 2.0–3.0, so answer B is incorrect because the doctor will not increase the dosage ofcoumadin. Answer C is incorrect because now is not the time to instruct the clientabout the therapy. Answer D is not correct because there is no need to increase theneurological assessment.
209. Answer C is correct. The food indicating the client’s understanding of dietary man-
agement of osteoporosis is the yogurt, with approximately 400mg of calcium. Theother foods are good choices, but not as good as the yogurt; therefore, answers A, B,and D are incorrect.

should be notified. Because the client is a minor, the court might order treatment.Answer A is incorrect because the mother is the legal guardian and can refuse theblood transfusion to be given to her daughter. Answers B and C are incorrect becauseit is not the primary responsibility of the nurse to encourage the mother to consent orexplain the consequences. 
212. Answer B is correct. The nurse should be most concerned with laryngeal edema
because of the area of burn. Answer A is of secondary priority. Hyponatremia andhypokalemia are also of concern but are not the primary concern; thus, answers C andD are incorrect. 
213. Answer D is correct. The client with anorexia shows the most improvement by
weight gain. Selecting a balanced diet is useless if the client does not eat the diet, soanswer A is incorrect. The hematocrit, in answer B, might improve by several means,such as blood transfusion, but that does not indicate improvement in the anorexiccondition, so B is incorrect. The tissue turgor indicates fluid, not improvement ofanorexia, so answer C is incorrect. 
214. Answer D is correct. Paresthesia of the toes is not normal and can indicate compart-
ment syndrome. At this time, pain beneath the cast is normal and, thus, would not bereported as a concern. The client’s toes should be warm to the touch, and pulses shouldbe present. Answers A, B, and C, then, are incorrect. 
215. Answer B is correct. The best response from the nurse is to let the client know that it

217. Answer D is correct. During ECT, the client will have a grand mal seizure. This indi-
cates completion of the electroconvulsive therapy. Answers A, B, and C are incorrectbecause they do not indicate that the ECT has been completed.

or inhaled. The eggs hatch in the upper intestine and mature in 2–8 weeks. Thefemales then mate and migrate out the anus, where they lay up to 17,000 eggs, caus-ing intense itching. The mother should be told to use a flashlight to examine the rectalarea about 2–3 hours after the child is asleep. Placing clear tape on a tongue bladewill allow the eggs to adhere to the tape. The specimen should then be evaluated in alab. There is no need to scrape the skin, collect a stool specimen, or bring a sample ofhair; therefore, answers B, C, and D are incorrect.
219. Answer B is correct. Erterobiasis, or pinworms, is treated with Vermox (mebenda-
zole) or Antiminth (pyrantel pamoate). The entire family should be treated, to ensurethat no eggs remain. Because a single treatment is usually sufficient, there is usuallygood compliance.

230. Answer A is correct. Before instilling eyedrops, the nurse should cleanse the area
with warm water. A 6-year-old child is not developmentally ready to instill his owneyedrops, so answer B is incorrect.

Answer D is incorrect andshows a lack of empathy for the child’s distress; it is an inappropriate response fromthe nurse. 
233. Answer B is correct. The hearing aid should be stored in a warm, dry place and
should be cleaned daily. A toothpick is inappropriate to clean the aid because it mightbreak off in the hearing aide. Changing the batteries weekly is not necessary; there-fore, answers A, C, and D are incorrect.01_0789737043_ch01.qxd  10/29/07  3:48 PM  Page 78

when selecting an answer. Although answers B and D might be appropriate for this
child, answer C should have the highest priority. Answer A does not apply for a childwho has undergone a tonsillectomy.
235. Answer A is correct. If the child has bacterial pneumonia, a high fever is usually pres-
ent. Bacterial pneumonia usually presents with a productive cough, so answer B isincorrect. Rhinitis, as stated in answer C, is often seen with viral pneumonia and isincorrect for this case. Vomiting and diarrhea are usually not seen with pneumonia;thus, answer D is incorrect. 
236. Answer B is correct. For a child with LTB and the possibility of complete obstruction

237. Answer C is correct. Exophthalmos (protrusion of eyeballs) often occurs with hyper-
thyroidism. The client with hyperthyroidism will often exhibit tachycardia, increasedappetite, and weight loss. Answers A, B, and D are not associated with hyperthy-roidism. 
238. Answer D is correct. The child with celiac disease should be on a gluten-free diet.
Answer D is the only choice of foods that do not contain gluten. Therefore, answers A,B, and C are incorrect. 
239. Answer C is correct. Remember the ABC’s (airway, breathing, circulation) when
answering this question. Before notifying the physician or assessing the child’s pulse,oxygen should be applied to increase the child’s oxygen saturation. The normal oxygensaturation for a child is 92%–100%. Answer A is important but not the priority,answer B is inappropriate, and answer D is also not the priority. 
240. Answer B is correct. Normal amniotic fluid is straw colored and odorless, so this is
the observation the nurse should expect. An amniotomy is artificial rupture of mem-branes, causing a straw-colored fluid to appear in the vaginal area. Fetal heart tones of160 indicate tachycardia, and this is not the observation to watch for. Greenish fluid isindicative of meconium, not amniotic fluid. If the nurse notes the umbilical cord, theclient is experiencing a prolapsed cord. This would need to be reported immediately.For this question, answers A, C, and D are incorrect. 
241. Answer D is correct. The client is usually given epidural anesthesia at approximately
three centimeters dilation. Answer A is vague, answer B would indicate the end of thefirst stage of labor, and answer C indicates the transition phase, not the latent phase oflabor. 
242. Answer B is correct. The normal fetal heart rate is 120–160bpm. A heart rate of
100–110bpm is bradycardia. The first action would be to turn the client to the left sideand apply oxygen. Answer A is not indicated at this time. Answer C is not the bestaction for clients experiencing bradycardia. There is no data to indicate the need tomove the client to the delivery room at this time, so answer D is incorrect as well.01_0789737043_ch01.qxd  10/29/07  3:48 PM  Page 79

243. Answer D is correct. The expected effect of Pitocin is progressive cervical dilation.
Pitocin causes more intense contractions, which can increase the pain; thus, answer A
is incorrect. Answers B and C are incorrect because cervical effacement is caused bypressure on the presenting part and there are not infrequent contractions. 
244. Answer B is correct. Applying a fetal heart monitor is the appropriate action at this
time. Preparing for a caesarean section is premature; placing the client inTrendelenburg is also not an indicated action, and an ultrasound is not needed basedon the finding. Therefore, answer B is the best answer, and answers A, C, and D areincorrect. 
245. Answer B is correct. Absent variability is not normal and could indicate a neurological
problem. Answers A, C, and D are normal findings. 
246. Answer D is correct. Clients admitted in labor are told not to eat during labor, to
avoid nausea and vomiting. Ice chips might be allowed, although this amount of fluidmight not be sufficient to prevent fluid volume deficit. In answer A, impaired gasexchange related to hyperventilation would be indicated during the transition phase,not the early phase of labor. Answers B and C are not correct because clients duringlabor are allowed to change position as she desires.
247. Answer D is correct. This information indicates a late deceleration. This type of decel-
eration is caused by uteroplacental insufficiency, or lack of oxygen. Answer A is incor-rect because there is no data to support the conclusion that the baby is asleep; answerB results in a variable deceleration; and answer C is indicative of an early deceleration.
248. Answer C is correct. The initial action by the nurse observing a variable deceleration
should be to turn the client to the side, preferably the left side. Administering oxygen isalso indicated. Answer A is not called for at this time. Answer B is incorrect because it isnot needed, and answer D is incorrect because there is no data to indicate that the moni-tor has been applied incorrectly. 
249. Answer D is correct. Answers A, B, and C indicate ominous findings on the fetal heart
monitor and so are incorrect in this instance. Accelerations with movement are nor-mal, so answer D is the reassuring pattern.
250. Answer C is correct. Epidural anesthesia decreases the urge to void and sensation of
a full bladder. A full bladder decreases the progression of labor. Answers A, B, and Dare incorrect because the bladder does not fill more rapidly due to the epidural, theclient is not in a trancelike state, and the client’s level of consciousness is not altered,and there is no evidence that the client is too embarrassed to ask for a bedpan.01_0789737043_ch01.qxd  10/29/07  3:48 PM  Page 80

Answers and Rationales
1. Answer D is correct. It is important to assess the extremities for blood vessel occlusion
in the client with sickle cell anemia because a change in capillary refill would indicate a
change in circulation. Body temperature, motion, and sensation would not give informa-tion regarding peripheral circulation; therefore, answers A, B, and C are incorrect.
2. Answer D is correct. Placing the client in semi-Fowler’s position provides the best
oxygenation for this client. Flexion of the hips and knees, which includes the knee-chest position, impedes circulation and is not correct positioning for this client.Therefore, answers A, B, and C are incorrect.
3. Answer B is correct. It is important to keep the client in sickle cell crisis hydrated to
prevent further sickling of the blood. Answer A is incorrect because a mechanical cuffplaces too much pressure on the arm. Answer C is incorrect because raising the kneegatch impedes circulation. Answer D is incorrect because Tylenol is too mild an anal-gesic for the client in crisis.
4. Answer C is correct. Hydration is important in the client with sickle cell disease to
prevent thrombus formation. Popsicles, gelatin, juice, and pudding have high fluidcontent. The foods in answers A, B, and D do not aid in hydration and are, therefore,incorrect.
5. Answer C is correct. The pulse oximetry indicates that oxygen levels are low; thus,
oxygenation takes precedence over pain relief. Answer A is incorrect because althougha warm environment reduces pain and minimizes sickling, it would not be a priority.Answer B is incorrect because although hydration is important, it would not require abolus. Answer D is incorrect because Demerol is acidifying to the blood and increasessickling.
6. Answer C is correct. Egg yolks, wheat bread, carrots, raisins, and green, leafy vegeta-
bles are all high in iron, which is an important mineral for this client. Roast beef, cab-bage, and pork chops are also high in iron, but the side dishes accompanying thesechoices are not; therefore, answers A, B, and D are incorrect. 
7. Answer D is correct. Taking a trip to the museum is the only answer that does not
pose a threat. A family vacation in the Rocky Mountains at high altitudes, cold temper-atures, and airplane travel can cause sickling episodes and should be avoided; there-fore, answers A, B, and C are incorrect. 
8. Answer D is correct. The tongue of the client with B12 insufficiency is red and beefy.
A, B, and C incorrect because enlarged spleen, elevated BP , and bradycardia are notassociated with B12 deficiency.
9. Answer C is correct. The oral mucosa and hard palate (roof of the mouth) are the best
indicators of jaundice in dark-skinned persons. The conjunctiva can have normal depositsof fat, which give a yellowish hue; thus, answer A is incorrect. The soles of the feet can beyellow if they are calloused, making answer B incorrect; the shins would be an area ofdarker pigment, so answer D is incorrect. Practice Exam 3 and Rationales
21503_0789737043_ch03.qxd  10/29/07  9:32 PM  Page 215
10. Answer B is correct. When there are fewer red blood cells, there is less hemoglobin
and less oxygen. Therefore, the client is often short of breath, as indicated in answer
B. The client with anemia is often pale in color, has weight loss, and may be hypoten-sive. Answers A, C, and D are within normal and, therefore, are incorrect.
11. Answer A is correct. The client with polycythemia vera is at risk for thrombus forma-
tion. Hydrating the client with at least 3L of fluid per day is important in preventingclot formation, so the statement to drink less than 500mL is incorrect. Answers B, C,and D are incorrect because they all contribute to the prevention of complications.Support hose promotes venous return, the electric razor prevents bleeding due toinjury, and a diet low in iron is essential to preventing further red cell formation. 
12. Answer C is correct. Radiation treatment for other types of cancer can contribute to
the development of leukemia. Some hobbies and occupations involving chemicals arelinked to leukemia, but not the ones in these answers; therefore, answers A and B areincorrect. Answer D is incorrect because the incidence of leukemia is higher in twinsnot siblings.
13. Answer D is correct. Petechiae are not usually visualized on dark skin. The soles of
the feet and palms of the hand provide a lighter surface for assessing the client forpetichiae. Answers A, B, and C are incorrect because the skin may be too dark tomake an assessment. 
14. Answer B is correct. The client with leukemia is at risk for infection and has often had
recurrent respiratory infections during the previous 6 months. Insomnolence, weightloss, and a decrease in alertness also occur in leukemia, but bleeding tendencies andinfections are the primary clinical manifestations; therefore, answers A, C, and D areincorrect. 
15. Answer B is correct. The client with acute leukemia has bleeding tendencies due to
decreased platelet counts, and any injury would exacerbate the problem. The clientwould require close monitoring for hemorrhage, which is of higher priority than thediagnoses in answers A, C, and D, which are incorrect.
16. Answer A is correct. Radiation therapy often causes sterility in male clients and would
be of primary importance to this client. The psychosocial needs of the client areimportant to address in light of the age and life choices. Hodgkin’s disease, however,has a good prognosis when diagnosed early. Answers B, C, and D are incorrectbecause they are of lesser priority.
17. Answer A is correct. Clients with autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura (ATP) have
low platelet counts, making answer A the correct answer. White cell counts, potassiumlevels, and PTT are not affected in ATP; thus, answers B, C, and D are incorrect.
18. Answer A is correct. The normal platelet count is 120,000–400,000. Bleeding occurs in
clients with low platelets. The priority is to prevent and minimize bleeding. Oxygenationin answer C is important, but platelets do not carry oxygen. Answers B and D are oflesser priority and are incorrect in this instance.
19. Answer C is correct. A prolactinoma is a type of pituitary tumor. Elevating the head of
the bed 30° avoids pressure on the sella turcica and helps to prevent headaches.Answers A, B, and D are incorrect because Trendelenburg, Valsalva maneuver, andcoughing all increase the intracranial pressure. 216 Chapter 303_0789737043_ch03.qxd  10/29/07  9:32 PM  Page 216
20. Answer B is correct. The large amount of fluid loss can cause fluid and electrolyte imbal-
ance that should be corrected. The loss of electrolytes would be reflected in the vital
signs. Measuring the urinary output is important, but the stem already says that the clienthas polyuria, so answer A is incorrect. Encouraging fluid intake will not correct the prob-lem, making answer C incorrect. Answer D is incorrect because weighing the client is notnecessary at this time. 
21. Answer C is correct. C is correct because direct pressure to the nose stops the bleed-
ing. Answers A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not stop bleeding
22. Answer A is correct. Blood pressure is the best indicator of cardiovascular collapse in the
client who has had an adrenal gland removed. The remaining gland might have been sup-pressed due to the tumor activity. Temperature would be an indicator of infection,decreased output would be a clinical manifestation but would take longer to occur thanblood pressure changes, and specific gravity changes occur with other disorders; there-fore, answers B, C, and D are incorrect.
23. Answer A is correct. IV glucocorticoids raise the glucose levels and often require cov-
erage with insulin. Answer B is not necessary at this time, sodium and potassium lev-els would be monitored when the client is receiving mineral corticoids, and dailyweights is unnecessary; therefore, answers B, C, and D are incorrect.
24. Answer B is correct. The parathyroid glands are responsible for calcium production and
can be damaged during a thyroidectomy. The tingling can be due to low calcium levels.The crash cart would be needed in respiratory distress but would not be the next actionto take; thus, answer A is incorrect. Hypertension occurs in thyroid storm and thedrainage would occur in hemorrhage, so answers C and D are incorrect.
25. Answer D is correct. The decrease in pulse can affect the cardiac output and lead to
shock, which would take precedence over the other choices; therefore, answers A, B,and C are incorrect.
26. Answer A is correct. The client taking antilipidemics should be encouraged to report
muscle weakness because this is a sign of rhabdomyolysis. The medication takeseffect within 1 month of beginning therapy, so answer B is incorrect. The medication should be taken with water because fruit juice, particularlygrapefruit, can decrease the effectiveness, making answer C incorrect. Liver functionstudies should be checked before beginning the medication, not after the fact, makinganswer D incorrect.
27. Answer B is correct. Hyperstat is given IV push for hypertensive crises, but it often
causes hyperglycemia. The glucose level will drop rapidly when stopped. Answer A isincorrect because the hyperstat is given by IV push. The client should be placed indorsal recumbent position, not Trendelenburg position, as stated in answer C. AnswerD is incorrect because the medication does not have to be covered with foil. 
28. Answer C is correct. A heart rate of 60 in the baby should be reported immediately.
The dose should be held if the heart rate is below 100bpm. The blood glucose, bloodpressure, and respirations are within normal limits; thus answers A, B, and D areincorrect.Practice Exam 3 and Rationales
21703_0789737043_ch03.qxd  10/29/07  9:32 PM  Page 217
29. Answer C is correct. Nitroglycerine should be kept in a brown bottle (or even a spe-
cial air- and water-tight, solid or plated silver or gold container) because of its instabil-
ity and tendency to become less potent when exposed to air, light, or water. The sup-ply should be replenished every 6 months, not 3 months, and one tablet should betaken every 5 minutes until pain subsides, so answers A and B are incorrect. If thepain does not subside, the client should report to the emergency room. The medica-tion should be taken sublingually and should not be crushed, as stated in answer D.
30. Answer C is correct. Turkey contains the least amount of fats and cholesterol. Liver,
eggs, beef, cream sauces, shrimp, cheese, and chocolate should be avoided by theclient; thus, answers A, B, and D are incorrect. The client should bake meat ratherthan frying to avoid adding fat to the meat during cooking.
31. Answer B is correct. The jugular veins in the neck should be assessed for distension.
The other parts of the body will be edematous in right-sided congestive heart failure,not left-sided; thus, answers A, C, and D are incorrect. 
32. Answer A is correct. The phlebostatic axis is located at the fifth intercostals space midax-
illary line and is the correct placement of the manometer. The PMI or point of maximalimpulse is located at the fifth intercostals space midclavicular line, so answer B is incor-rect. Erb’s point is the point at which you can hear the valves close simultaneously, mak-ing answer C incorrect. The Tail of Spence (the upper outer quadrant of the breast) is thearea where most breast cancers are located and has nothing to do with placement of amanometer; thus, answer D is incorrect.
33. Answer B is correct. Zestril is an ACE inhibitor and is frequently given with a diuretic
such as Lasix for hypertension. Answers A, C, and D are incorrect because the orderis accurate. There is no need to question the order, administer the medication sepa-rately, or contact the pharmacy. 
34. Answer B is correct. The best indicator of peripheral edema is measuring the extremi-
ty. A paper tape measure should be used rather than one made of plastic or cloth, andthe area should be marked with a pen, providing the most objective assessment.Answer A is incorrect because weighing the client will not indicate peripheral edema.Answer C is incorrect because checking the intake and output will not indicate periph-eral edema. Answer D is incorrect because checking for pitting edema is less reliablethan measuring with a paper tape measure.
35. Answer D is correct. Clients with radium implants should have close contact limited
to 30 minutes per visit. The general rule is limiting time spent exposed to radium, put-ting distance between people and the radium source, and using lead to shield againstthe radium. Teaching the family member these principles is extremely important.Answers A, B, and C are not empathetic and do not address the question; therefore,they are incorrect.
36. Answer B is correct. The client with a facial stroke will have difficulty swallowing and
chewing, and the foods in answer B provide the least amount of chewing. The foods inanswers A, C, and D would require more chewing and, thus, are incorrect. 218 Chapter 303_0789737043_ch03.qxd  10/29/07  9:32 PM  Page 218
37. Answer A is correct. Novalog insulin onsets very quickly, so food should be available
within 10–15 minutes of taking the insulin. Answer B does not address a particular
type of insulin, so it is incorrect. NPH insulin peaks in 8–12 hours, so a snack shouldbe eaten at the expected peak time. It may not be 3 p.m. as stated in answer C.Answer D is incorrect because there is no need to save the dessert until bedtime.
38. Answer B is correct. The umbilical cord needs time to dry and fall off before putting
the infant in the tub. Although answers A, C, and D might be important, they are notthe primary answer to the question.
39. Answer D is correct. Leucovorin is the antidote for Methotrexate and Trimetrexate
which are folic acid antagonists. Leucovorin is a folic acid derivative. Answers A, B,and C are incorrect because Leucovorin does not treat iron deficiency, increase neu-trophils, or have a synergistic effect. 
40. Answer A is correct. The Hemophilus influenza vaccine is given at 4 months with the
polio vaccine. Answers B, C, and D are incorrect because these vaccines are given
later in life.
41. Answer A is correct. Proton pump inhibitors should be taken prior to the meal.
Answers B, C, and D are incorrect times for giving proton pump inhibitors like Nexium.
42. Answer A is correct. If the client is a threat to the staff and to other clients the nurse
should call for help and prepare to administer a medication such as Haldol to sedatehim. Answer B is incorrect because simply telling the client to calm down will not work.Answer C is incorrect because telling the client that if he continues he will be punishedis a threat and may further anger him. Answer D is incorrect because if the client is leftalone he might harm himself.
43. Answer A is correct. If the fundus of the client is displaced to the side, this might
indicate a full bladder. The next action by the nurse should be to check for bladder dis-tention and catheterize, if necessary. The answers in B, C, and D are actions that relateto postpartal hemorrhage. 
44. Answer C is correct. A low-grade temperature, blood-tinged sputum, fatigue, and night
sweats are symptoms consistent with tuberculosis. If the answer in A had said pneumo-cystis pneumonia, answer A would have been consistent with the symptoms given in thestem, but just saying pneumonia isn’t specific enough to diagnose the problem.Answers B and D are not directly related to the stem. 
45. Answer B is correct. If the client has a history of Prinzmetal’s angina, he should not
be prescribed triptan preparations because they cause vasoconstriction and coronaryspasms. There is no contraindication for taking triptan drugs in clients with diabetes,cancer, or cluster headaches making answers A, C, and D incorrect.Practice Exam 3 and Rationales

46. Answer A is correct. Kernig’s sign is positive if pain occurs on flexion of the hip and
knee. The Brudzinski reflex is positive if pain occurs on flexion of the head and neck
onto the chest so answer B is incorrect. Answers C and D might be present but arenot related to Kernig’s sign. 
47. Answer B is correct. Apraxia is the inability to use objects appropriately. Agnosia is
loss of sensory comprehension, anomia is the inability to find words, and aphasia isthe inability to speak or understand so answers A, C, and D are incorrect.
48. Answer C is correct. Increased confusion at night is known as “sundowning” syn-
drome. This increased confusion occurs when the sun begins to set and continuesduring the night. Answer A is incorrect because fatigue is not necessarily present.Increased confusion at night is not part of normal aging; therefore, answer B is incor-rect. A delusion is a firm, fixed belief; therefore, answer D is incorrect. 
49. Answer C is correct. The client who is confused might forget that he ate earlier. Don’t
argue with the client. Simply get him something to eat that will satisfy him until lunch.
Answers A and D are incorrect because the nurse is dismissing the client. Answer B isvalidating the delusion.
50. Answer D is correct. Nausea and gastrointestinal upset are very common in clients
taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as Exelon. Other side effects include livertoxicity, dizziness, unsteadiness, and clumsiness. The client might already be experi-encing urinary incontinence or headaches, but they are not necessarily associated;and the client with Alzheimer’s disease is already confused. Therefore, answers A, B,and C are incorrect.
51. Answer B is correct. Any lesion should be reported to the doctor. This can indicate a
herpes lesion. Clients with open lesions related to herpes are delivered by Cesareansection because there is a possibility of transmission of the infection to the fetus withdirect contact to lesions. It is not enough to document the finding, so answer A isincorrect. The physician must make the decision to perform a C-section, makinganswer C incorrect.

61. Answer D is correct. If the client experiences hypotension after an injection of epidur-
al anesthetic, the nurse should turn her to the left side, apply oxygen by mask, andspeed the IV infusion. If the blood pressure does not return to normal, the physicianshould be contacted. Epinephrine should be kept for emergency administration.Answer A is incorrect because placing the client in Trendelenburg position (headdown) will allow the anesthesia to move up above the respiratory center, therebydecreasing the diaphragm’s ability to move up and down and ventilate the client. Inanswer B, the IV rate should be increased, not decreased. In answer C, the oxygenshould be applied by mask, not cannula. 
62. Answer A is correct. Cancer of the pancreas frequently leads to severe nausea and
vomiting and altered glucose levels. The other problems are of lesser concern; thus,answers B, C, and D are incorrect.

sion. B and C are vague answers and are therefore incorrect. D does not directly relate
to glomerulonephritis.
97. Answer B is correct. A child with epiglottis has the possibility of complete obstruction
of the airway. For this reason the nurse should not evaluate the airway using a tongueblade. A, C, and D are allowed actions and are therefore incorrect.
98. Answer C is correct. Exophthalmos (protrusion of eyeballs) often occurs with hyperthy-
roidism. The client with hyperthyroidism will often exhibit tachycardia, increasedappetite, and weight loss; therefore, answers A, B, and D are incorrect.

100. Answer C is correct. Remember the ABCs (airway, breathing, circulation) when
answering this question. Before notifying the physician or assessing the pulse, oxygen
should be applied to increase the oxygen saturation, so answers A and D are incor-rect. The normal oxygen saturation is 92%–100%, making answer B incorrect.
101. Answer B is correct. An amniotomy is an artificial rupture of membranes and normal
amniotic fluid is straw-colored and odorless. A, C, and D are abnormal findings.

103. Answer B is correct. The normal fetal heart rate is 120–160bpm; 100–110bpm is
bradycardia. The first action would be to turn the client to the left side and apply oxy-gen. Answer A is not indicated at this time. Answer C is not the best action for clientsexperiencing bradycardia. There is no data to indicate the need to move the client tothe delivery room at this time.
104. Answer D is correct. Arterial ulcers are painful. A, B, and C are incorrect because they
do not describe arterial ulcers.
105. Answer B is correct. Applying a fetal heart monitor is the correct action at this time.
There is no need to prepare for a Caesarean section or to place the client in GenuPectoral position (knee-chest), so answers A and C are incorrect. Answer D is incorrectbecause there is no need for an ultrasound based on the finding.
106. Answer B is correct. The nurse decides to apply an external monitor because the
membranes are intact. Answers A, C, and D are incorrect. The cervix is dilated enoughto use an internal monitor, if necessary. An internal monitor can be applied if the clientis at 0-station. Contraction intensity has no bearing on the application of the fetalmonitor.
107. Answer D is correct. Clients admitted in labor are told not to eat during labor, to avoid
nausea and vomiting. Ice chips may be allowed, but this amount of fluid might not besufficient to prevent fluid volume deficit. In answer A, impaired gas exchange relatedto hyperventilation would be indicated during the transition phase. Answers B and Care not correct in relation to the stem.
108. Answer D is correct. This information indicates a late deceleration. This type of decel-
eration is caused by uteroplacental lack of oxygen. Answer A has no relation to thereadings, so it’s incorrect; answer B results in a variable deceleration; and answer C isindicative of an early deceleration.
109. Answer C is correct. The initial action by the nurse observing a late deceleration
should turn the client to the side—preferably, the left side. Administering oxygen isalso indicated. Answer A might be necessary but not before turning the client to herside.

22503_0789737043_ch03.qxd  10/29/07  9:32 PM  Page 225
110. Answer D is correct. A deceleration to 90–100bpm at the end of contractions are late
decelerations. This finding is ominous (bad) and should be reported. A, B, and D are
normal findings and are therefore incorrect.
111. Answer C is correct. Epidural anesthesia decreases the urge to void and sensation of
a full bladder. A full bladder will decrease the progression of labor. Answers A, B, andD are incorrect for the stem.
112. Answer B is correct. Lutenizing hormone released by the pituitary is responsible for
ovulation. At about day 14, the continued increase in estrogen stimulates the release
of lutenizing hormone from the anterior pituitary. The LH surge is responsible for ovu-lation, or the release of the dominant follicle in preparation for conception, whichoccurs within the next 10–12 hours after the LH levels peak. Answers A, C, and D areincorrect because estrogen levels are high at the beginning of ovulation, the endome-trial lining is thick, not thin, and the progesterone levels are high, not low.
113. Answer C is correct. The success of the rhythm method of birth control is dependent
on the client’s menses being regular. It is not dependent on the age of the client, fre-quency of intercourse, or range of the client’s temperature; therefore, answers A, B,and D are incorrect.
114. Answer C is correct. The best method of birth control for the client with diabetes is the
diaphragm. A permanent intrauterine device can cause a continuing inflammatoryresponse in diabetics that should be avoided, oral contraceptives tend to elevate bloodglucose levels, and contraceptive sponges are not good at preventing pregnancy.Therefore, answers A, B, and D are incorrect.
115. Answer D is correct. The signs of an ectopic pregnancy are vague until the fallopian
tube ruptures. The client will complain of sudden, stabbing pain in the lower quadrantthat radiates down the leg or up into the chest. Painless vaginal bleeding is a sign ofplacenta previa, abdominal cramping is a sign of labor, and throbbing pain in theupper quadrant is not a sign of an ectopic pregnancy, making answers A, B, and Cincorrect.
116. Answer C is correct. All of the choices are tasty, but the pregnant client needs a diet
that is balanced and has increased amounts of calcium. Answer A is lacking in fruitsand milk. Answer B contains the potato chips, which contain a large amount of sodi-um. Answer C contains meat, fruit, potato salad, and yogurt, which has about 360mgof calcium. Answer D is not the best diet because it lacks vegetables and milk prod-ucts.
117. Answer B is correct. The client with hyperemesis has persistent nausea and vomiting.
With vomiting comes dehydration. When the client is dehydrated, she will have meta-bolic acidosis. Answers A and C are incorrect because they are respiratory dehydra-tion. Answer D is incorrect because the client will not be in alkalosis with persistentvomiting.
118. Answer B is correct. The most definitive diagnosis of pregnancy is the presence of
fetal heart tones. The signs in answers A, C, and D are subjective and might be relatedto other medical conditions. Answers A and C may be related to a hydatidiform mole,and answer D is often present before menses or with the use of oral contraceptives.226 Chapter 303_0789737043_ch03.qxd  10/29/07  9:32 PM  Page 226
119. Answer C is correct. The infant of a diabetic mother is usually large for gestational
age. After birth, glucose levels fall rapidly due to the absence of glucose from the
mother. Answer A is incorrect because the infant will not be small for gestational age.Answer B is incorrect because the infant will not be hyperglycemic. Answer D is incor-rect because the infant will be large, not small, and will be hypoglycemic, not hyper-glycemic.
120. Answer B is correct. When the client is taking oral contraceptives and begins antibi-
otics, another method of birth control should be used. Antibiotics decrease the effec-tiveness of oral contraceptives. Approximately 5–10 pounds of weight gain is notunusual, so answer A is incorrect. If the client misses a birth control pill, she shouldbe instructed to take the pill as soon as she remembers the pill. Answer C is incorrect.If she misses two, she should take two; if she misses more than two, she should takethe missed pills but use another method of birth control for the remainder of thecycle. Answer D is incorrect because changes in menstrual flow are expected inclients using oral contraceptives. Often these clients have lighter menses.
121. Answer B is correct. Clients with HIV should not breastfeed because the infection can
be transmitted to the baby through breast milk. The clients in answers A, C, and D—those with diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid disease—can be allowed to breastfeed.
122. Answer A is correct. The symptoms of painless vaginal bleeding are consistent with
placenta previa. Answers B, C, and D are incorrect. Cervical check for dilation is con-traindicated because this can increase the bleeding. Checking for firmness of theuterus can be done, but the first action should be to check the fetal heart tones. Adetailed history can be done later.
123. Answer D is correct. The client should be advised to come to the labor and delivery
unit when the contractions are every 5 minutes and consistent. She should also betold to report to the hospital if she experiences rupture of membranes or extremebleeding. She should not wait until the contractions are every 2 minutes or until shehas bloody discharge, so answers A and B are incorrect. Answer C is a vague answerand can be related to a urinary tract infection.
124. Answer A is correct. Infants of mothers who smoke are often low in birth weight.
Infants who are large for gestational age are associated with diabetic mothers, soanswer B is incorrect. Preterm births are associated with smoking, but not with appro-priate size for gestation, making answer C incorrect. Growth retardation is associatedwith smoking, but this does not affect the infant length; therefore, answer D is incor-rect.
125. Answer A is correct. To provide protection against antibody production, RhoGam
should be given within 72 hours. The answers in B, C, and D are too late to provideantibody protection. RhoGam can also be given during pregnancy.
126. Answer B is correct. When the membranes rupture, there is often a transient drop in
the fetal heart tones. The heart tones should return to baseline quickly. Any alterationin fetal heart tones, such as bradycardia or tachycardia, should be reported. After thefetal heart tones are assessed, the nurse should evaluate the cervical dilation, vitalsigns, and level of discomfort, making answers A, C, and D incorrect.Practice Exam 3 and Rationales

127. Answer A is correct. The active phase of labor occurs when the client is dilated
4–7cm. The latent or early phase of labor is from 1cm to 3cm in dilation, so answers
B and D are incorrect. The transition phase of labor is 8–10cm in dilation, makinganswer C incorrect.
128. Answer B is correct. The infant of an addicted mother will undergo withdrawal. Snugly
wrapping the infant in a blanket will help prevent the muscle irritability that thesebabies often experience. Teaching the mother to provide tactile stimulation or providefor early infant stimulation are incorrect because he is irritable and needs quiet and lit-tle stimulation at this time, so answers A and D are incorrect. Placing the infant in aninfant seat in answer C is incorrect because this will also cause movement that canincrease muscle irritability.
129. Answer C is correct. Following epidural anesthesia, the client should be checked for
hypotension and signs of shock every 5 minutes for 15 minutes. The client can bechecked for cervical dilation later after she is stable. The client should not be posi-tioned supine because the anesthesia can move above the respiratory center and theclient can stop breathing. Fetal heart tones should be assessed after the blood pres-sure is checked. Therefore, answers A, B, and D are incorrect.
130. Answer B is correct. The best way to prevent post-operative wound infection is hand
washing. Use of prescribed antibiotics will treat infection, not prevent infections, mak-ing answer A incorrect. Wearing a mask and asking the client to cover her mouth aregood practices but will not prevent wound infections; therefore, answers C and D areincorrect.
131. Answer B is correct. The client with a hip fracture will most likely have disalignment.
Answers A, C, and D are incorrect because all fractures cause pain, and coolness ofthe extremities and absence of pulses are indicative of compartment syndrome orperipheral vascular disease.
132. Answer B is correct. After menopause, women lack hormones necessary to absorb
and utilize calcium. Doing weight-bearing exercises and taking calcium supplementscan help to prevent osteoporosis but are not causes, so answers A and C are incor-rect. Body types that frequently experience osteoporosis are thin Caucasian females,but they are not most likely related to osteoporosis, so answer D is incorrect.
133. Answer B is correct. The infant’s hips should be off the bed approximately 15° in
Bryant’s traction. Answer A is incorrect because this does not indicate that the tractionis working correctly, nor does C. Answer D is incorrect because Bryant’s traction is askin traction, not a skeletal traction.
134. Answer A is correct. Balanced skeletal traction uses pins and screws. A Steinman pin
goes through large bones and is used to stabilize large bones such as the femur.Answer B is incorrect because only the affected leg is in traction. Kirschner wires areused to stabilize small bones such as fingers and toes, as in answer C. Answer D isincorrect because this type of traction is not used for fractured hips.
135. Answer A is correct. Bleeding is a common complication of orthopedic surgery. The
blood-collection device should be checked frequently to ensure that the client is nothemorrhaging. The client’s pain should be assessed, but this is not life-threatening.When the client is in less danger, the nutritional status should be assessed and animmobilizer is not used; thus, answers B, C, and D are incorrect. 228 Chapter 303_0789737043_ch03.qxd  10/29/07  9:32 PM  Page 228
136. Answer A is correct. The client’s family member should be taught to flush the tube
after each feeding and clamp the tube. The placement should be checked before feed-
ings, and indigestion can occur with the PEG tube, just as it can occur with any client,so answers B and C are incorrect. Medications can be ordered for indigestion, but it isnot a reason for alarm. A percutaneous endoscopy gastrostomy tube is used forclients who have experienced difficulty swallowing. The tube is inserted directly intothe stomach and does not require swallowing; therefore, answer D is incorrect.
137. Answer C is correct. The client with a total knee replacement should be assessed for
anemia. An hgb of 7 is extremely low and might require a blood transfusion. Scantbleeding on the dressing is not extreme. Circle and date and time the bleeding andmonitor for changes in the client’s status. A low-grade temperature is not unusualafter surgery. Ensure that the client is well hydrated, and recheck the temperature inone hour. Voiding after surgery is also not uncommon and no need for concern; there-fore, answers A, B, and D are incorrect.
138. Answer B is correct. The parents make stained glass as a hobby. Stained glass is put
together with lead, which can drop on the work area, where the child can consume thelead beads. Answers A, C, and D do not pose a threat to the child.
139. Answer A is correct. The equipment that can help with activities of daily living is the
high-seat commode. The hip should be kept higher than the knee. The recliner is goodbecause it prevents 90° flexion but not daily activities. A TENS (TranscutaneousElectrical Nerve Stimulation) unit helps with pain management and an abduction pil-low is used to prevent adduction of the hip and possibly dislocation of the prosthesis;therefore, answers B, C, and D are incorrect.
140. Answer B is correct. Narcan is the antidote for narcotic overdose. If hypoxia occurs,
the client should have oxygen administered by mask, not cannula. There is no data tosupport the administration of blood products or cardioresuscitation, so answers A, C,and D are incorrect.
141. Answer B is correct. The 6-year-old should have a roommate as close to the same
age as possible, so the 12-year-old is the best match. The 10-year-old with sarcomahas cancer and will be treated with chemotherapy that makes him immune sup-pressed, the 6-year-old with osteomylitis is infected, and the client in answer A is tooold and is female; therefore, answers A, C, and D are incorrect.
142. Answer B is correct. Cox II inhibitors have been associated with heart attacks and
strokes. Any changes in cardiac status or signs of a stroke should be reported imme-diately, along with any changes in bowel or bladder habits because bleeding has beenlinked to use of Cox II inhibitors. The client does not have to take the medication withmilk, remain upright, or allow 6 weeks for optimal effect, so answers A, C, and D areincorrect.
143. Answer D is correct. A plaster-of-Paris cast takes 24 hours to dry, and the client
should not bear weight for 24 hours. The cast should be handled with the palms, notthe fingertips, so answer A is incorrect. Petaling a cast is covering the end of the castwith cast batting or a sock, to prevent skin irritation and flaking of the skin under thecast. B is incorrect because petaling the cast is done by the health care provider whoapplied the cast. The client should be told not to dry the cast with a hair dryer becausethis causes hot spots and could burn the client. This also causes unequal drying; thus,answer C is incorrect.Practice Exam 3 and Rationales

to autograph the cast; it will not harm the cast in any way, so answers B, C, and D are
incorrect. 
145. Answer A is correct. The nurse is performing the pin care correctly when she uses ster-
ile gloves and Q-tips. Clean gloves are not acceptable. A licensed practical nurse canperform pin care, there is no need to clean the weights; therefore, answers B, C, and Dare incorrect.
146. Answer A is correct. A body cast or spica cast extends from the upper abdomen to
the knees or below. Bowel sounds should be checked to ensure that the client is notexperiencing a paralytic illeus. Checking the blood pressure is a treatment for any client, offering pain medication is not called for, andchecking for swelling isn’t specific to the stem, so answers B, C, and D are incorrect.
147. Answer C is correct. Halo traction will be ordered for the client with a cervical frac-
ture. Russell’s traction is used for bones of the lower extremities, as is Buck’s traction.Cruchfield tongs are used while in the hospital and the client is immobile; therefore,answers A, B, and D are incorrect.
148. Answer B is correct. The controller for the continuous passive-motion device should
be placed away from the client. Many clients complain of pain while having treatmentswith the CPM, so they might turn off the machine. The CPM flexes and extends theleg. The client is in the bed during CPM therapy, so answer A is incorrect. Answer C isincorrect because clients will experience pain with the treatment. Use of the CPM doesnot alleviate the need for physical therapy, as suggested in answer D.
149. Answer A is correct. The client’s palms should rest lightly on the handles. The elbows
should be flexed no more than 30° but should not be extended. Answer B is incorrectbecause 0° is not a relaxed angle for the elbows and will not facilitate correct walkeruse. The client should walk to the middle of the walker, not to the front of the walker,making answer C incorrect. The client should be taught not to carry the walkerbecause this would not provide stability; thus, answer D is incorrect.
150. Answer C is correct. The client with a prolapsed cord should be treated by elevating
the hips and covering the cord with a moist, sterile saline gauze. The nurse should useher fingers to push up on the presenting part until a cesarean section can be per-formed.

151. Answer B is correct. Chest tubes work to reinflate the lung and drain serous fluid. The
tube does not equalize expansion of the lungs. Pain is associated with collapse of thelung, and insertion of chest tubes is painful, so answers A and C are incorrect. AnswerD is true, but this is not the primary rationale for performing chest tube insertion. 
152. Answer D is correct. Success with breastfeeding depends on many factors, but the
most dependable reason for success is desire and willingness to continue the breast-feeding until the infant and mother have time to adapt. The educational level, theinfant’s birth weight, and the size of the mother’s breast have nothing to do with suc-cess, so answers A, B, and C are incorrect.230 Chapter 303_0789737043_ch03.qxd  10/29/07  9:32 PM  Page 230
153. Answer C is correct. Green-tinged amniotic fluid is indicative of meconium staining.

as are frequent urination and moderate uterine contractions, making answers A, B,and D incorrect.
154. Answer C is correct. Duration is measured from the beginning of one contraction to
the end of the same contraction. Answer A refers to frequency. Answer B is incorrectbecause we do not measure from the end of one contraction to the beginning of thenext contraction. Duration is not measured from the peak of the contraction to theend, as stated in D.
155. Answer B is correct. The client receiving Pitocin should be monitored for decelera-
tions. There is no association with Pitocin use and hypoglycemia, maternal hyper-reflexia, or fetal movement; therefore, answers A, C, and D are incorrect.
156. Answer D is correct. Fetal development depends on adequate nutrition and insulin
regulation. Insulin needs increase during the second and third trimesters, insulinrequirements do not moderate as the pregnancy progresses, and elevated humanchoronic gonadotrophin elevates insulin needs, not decreases them; therefore,answers A, B, and C are incorrect. 
157. Answer A is correct. A calm environment is needed to prevent seizure activity. Any
stimulation can precipitate seizures. Obtaining a diet history should be done later, andadministering an analgesic is not indicated because there is no data in the stem toindicate pain. Therefore, answers B and C are incorrect. Assessing the fetal hearttones is important, but this is not the highest priority in this situation as stated inanswer D. 
158. Answer A is correct. The client who is age 42 is at risk for fetal anomalies such as Down
syndrome and other chromosomal aberrations. Answers B, C, and D are incorrectbecause the client is not at higher risk for respiratory distress syndrome or pathologicaljaundice, and Turner’s syndrome is a genetic disorder.

Prostin E. is a form of prostaglandin used to soften the cervix. Magnesium sulfate isused for preterm labor and preeclampsia, calcium gluconate is the antidote for mag-nesium sulfate, and Parlodel is a dopamine receptor stimulant used to treatParkinson’s disease; therefore, answers A, B, and D are incorrect. Parlodel was usedat one time to dry breast milk.
160. Answer A is correct. The client’s blood pressure and urinary output are within normal
limits. The only alteration from normal is the decreased deep tendon reflexes. Thenurse should continue to monitor the blood pressure and check the magnesium level.The therapeutic level is 4.8–9.6mg/dL. Answers B, C, and D are incorrect becausethere is no need to stop the infusion at this time or slow the rate. Calcium gluconate isthe antidote for magnesium sulfate, but there is no data to indicate toxicity.
161. Answer C is correct. Autosomal recessive disorders can be passed from the parents
to the infant. If both parents pass the trait, the child will get two abnormal genes andthe disease results. Parents can also pass the trait to the infant. Answer A is incorrectbecause, to have an affected newborn, the parents must be carriers. Answer B isincorrect because both parents must be carriers.

163. Answer B is correct. During pregnancy, the thyroid gland triples in size. This makes it
more difficult to regulate thyroid medication. Answer A is incorrect because there couldbe a need for thyroid medication during pregnancy. Answer C is incorrect because thethyroid function does not slow. Fetal growth is not arrested if thyroid medication is con-tinued, so answer D is incorrect.
164. Answer C is correct. Cyanosis of the feet and hands is acrocyanosis. This is a normal
finding 1 minute after birth. An apical pulse should be 120–160, and the baby shouldhave muscle tone, making answers A and B incorrect. Jaundice immediately after birthis pathological jaundice and is abnormal, so answer D is incorrect.
165. Answer A is correct. Clients with sickle cell crises are treated with heat, hydration,
oxygen, and pain relief. Fluids are increased, not decreased. Blood transfusions areusually not required, and the client can be delivered vaginally; thus, answers B, C, andD are incorrect.

Answers A, B, and C are incorrect because they are too low.
168. Answer B is correct. A nonstress test is done to evaluate periodic movement of the
fetus. It is not done to evaluate lung maturity as in answer A. An oxytocin challengetest shows the effect of contractions on fetal heart rate and a nonstress test does notmeasure neurological well-being of the fetus, so answers C and D are incorrect.
169. Answer D is correct. Hypospadias is a condition in which there is an opening on the
under side of the penis. Answers A, B, and C do not describe hypospadias thereforethey are incorrect.

observation is ordered to prevent the client from harming himself during withdrawal.Answers A, C, and D are incorrect because hallucinogenic drugs don’t create bothstimulant and depressant effects or produce severe respiratory depression. However,they do produce psychological dependence rather than physical dependence.
176. Answer B is correct. Barbiturates create a sedative effect. When the client stops tak-
ing barbiturates, he will experience tachycardia, diarrhea, and tachpnea. Answer A isincorrect even though depression and suicidal ideation go along with barbiturate use;it is not the priority. Muscle cramps and abdominal pain are vague symptoms thatcould be associated with other problems. Tachycardia is associated with stopping bar-biturates, but euphoria is not.
177. Answer A is correct. If the fetal heart tones are heard in the right upper abdomen, the
infant is in a breech presentation. If the infant is positioned in the right occipital ante-rior presentation, the FHTs will be located in the right lower quadrant, so answer B isincorrect. If the fetus is in the sacral position, the FHTs will be located in the center ofthe abdomen, so answer C is incorrect. If the FHTs are heard in the left lowerabdomen, the infant is most likely in the left occipital transverse position, makinganswer D incorrect.
178. Answer D is correct. Asthma is the presence of bronchiolar spasms. This spasm can
be brought on by allergies or anxiety. Answer A is incorrect because the primary phys-iological alteration is not inflammation. Answer B is incorrect because there is the pro-duction of abnormally viscous mucus, not a primary alteration. Answer C is incorrectbecause infection is not primary to asthma.
179. Answer A is correct. The client with mania is seldom sitting long enough to eat and
burns many calories for energy. Answer B is incorrect because the client should betreated the same as other clients.

188. Answer D is correct. Clients taking Acyclovir should be encouraged to drink plenty of
fluids because renal impairment can occur. Limiting activity is not necessary, nor iseating a high-carbohydrate diet. Use of an incentive spirometer is not specific toclients taking Acyclovir; therefore, answers A, B, and C are incorrect.
189. Answer A is correct. Clients who are pregnant should not have a CAT because
radioactive isotopes are used. However, clients with a titanium hip replacement canhave an MRI, or CAT scan so answer B is incorrect. No antibiotics are used with thistest and the client should remain still only when instructed, so answers C and D arenot specific to this test.
190. Answer D is correct. Clients taking Amphotericin B should be monitored for liver,
renal, and bone marrow function because this drug is toxic to the kidneys and liver,and causes bone marrow suppression. Jaundice is a sign of liver toxicity and is notspecific to the use of Amphotericin B. Changes in vision are not related, and nausea isa side effect, not a sign of toxicity; nor is urinary frequency. Thus, answers A, B, and Care incorrect.234 Chapter 303_0789737043_ch03.qxd  10/29/07  9:32 PM  Page 234

Oxytoxic drugs (Pitocin) are drugs usedto contract the uterus, so answer C is incorrect. It has nothing to do with displace-ment of the uterus. Answer D is incorrect because displacement is associated with afull bladder, not vaginal bleeding. 
206. Answer C is correct. Clients with an internal defibrillator or a pacemaker should not
have an MRI because it can cause dysrhythmias in the client with a pacemaker. If theclient has a need for oxygen, is claustrophobic, or is deaf, he can have an MRI, butprovisions such as extension tubes for the oxygen, sedatives, or a signal systemshould be made to accommodate these problems. Therefore, answers A, B, and D areincorrect.

pression. If Pitocin is infusing, the nurse should turn off the Pitocin. Instructing theclient to push is incorrect because pushing could increase the decelerations andbecause the client is 8cm dilated, making answer A incorrect. Performing a vaginal examshould be done after turning off the Pitocin, and placing the client in a semi-Fowler’sposition is not appropriate for this situation; therefore, answers B and D are incorrect.
244. Answer C is correct. The graph indicates ventricular tachycardia. The answers in A, B,
and D are not noted on the ECG strip.
245. Answer B is correct. Lovenox injections should be given in the abdomen, not in the
deltoid muscle. The client should not aspirate after the injection or clear the air fromthe syringe before injection. Therefore, answers A, C, and D are incorrect.
246. Answer B is correct. Valium is not given in the same syringe with other medications,
so answer A is incorrect. These medications can be given to the same client, soanswer D is incorrect. In answer C, it is not necessary to wait to inject the secondmedication. Valium is an antianxiety medication, and Phenergan is used as anantiemetic. 
247. Answer B is correct. Voiding every 3 hours prevents stagnant urine from collecting in
the bladder, where bacteria can grow. Douching is not recommended and obtaining aurinalysis monthly is not necessary, making answers A and C incorrect. The clientshould practice wiping from front to back after voiding and bowel movements, soanswer D is incorrect.
248. Answer C is correct. Of these clients, the one who should be assigned to the care of
the nursing assistant is the client with dementia. Only an RN or the physician canplace the client in seclusion, so answer A is incorrect. The nurse should empty theFoley catheter of the preeclamptic client because the client is unstable, making answerB incorrect. A nurse or physical therapist should ambulate the client with a fracturedhip, so answer D is incorrect.
249. Answer A is correct. The client who has recently had a thyroidectomy is at risk for
tracheal edema. A padded tongue blade is used for seizures and not for the client withtracheal edema, so answer B is incorrect. If the client experiences tracheal edema, theendotracheal tube or airway will not correct the problem, so answers C and D areincorrect. 
250. Answer D is correct. Histoplasmosis is a fungus carried by birds. It is not transmitted
to humans by cats, dogs, or turtles. Therefore, answers A, B, and C are incorrect.240 Chapter 303_0789737043_ch03.qxd  10/29/07  9:32 PM  Page 240

Silvadene. The nurse would need to assess the laboratory test results for this adverseeffect. Decreased potassium, sodium, and platelets are not associated with Silvadeneadministration, which makes answers A, C, and D incorrect.
230. Answer B is correct. The client most likely to experience complications is the one
with the short delivery time due to the possible trauma and lacerations of the birthcanal; therefore, she should be seen first. The clients in answers A, C, and D lack thecriteria to make them a priority-level visit requirement.400 Chapter 505_0789737043_ch05.qxd  10/29/07  10:20 PM  Page 400
231. Answer A is correct. Tactile fremitus is checked by asking the client to repeat terms
such as one, two, three as the nurse’s hands move down the thorax. Air does not con-
duct sound as well as a solid substance, so fremitus is increased with a solid sub-
stance and decreased when air is present, as with emphysema. Answers B and D aresolid-tissue illnesses that would result in increased, not decreased, tactile fremitus.Answer C is incorrect because bronchopneumonia usually develops with tuberculosis,causing increased fremitus.
232. Answer A is correct. Zyban and Wellbutrin are classified as antidepressants and have
been proven to increase long-term smoking abstinence. Answers B and C are bron-chodilator drugs and are not used for smoking cessation. Answer D is a short-actingbenzodiazepine and is not used for smoking-cessation therapy.
233. Answer D is correct. Pitocin is administered post-delivery to contract the uterus,
resulting in a firm uterus and less chance of hemorrhage. Answers A and C are notdesired effects of this drug. The contraction of the uterus is painful, which makesanswer B incorrect.
234. Answer A is correct. Arterial blood gas PO
2of 98 indicates adequate oxygenation and
a favorable outcome. Answers B, C, and D are undesirable negative assessment find-ings, which makes them incorrect.
235. Answer C is correct. Asthma is the only disorder that is reversible with treatment or
spontaneously after the attack. Answers A, B, and D can produce permanent damageto parts of the respiratory system, so they are incorrect.
236. Answer B is correct. The client’s respirations would be assessed before administering
morphine because morphine can cause respiratory depression. Answers C and D haveno correlation with morphine administration, so they are incorrect. Answer A would bethe next action after the assessment of a normal respiratory rate, but it would not bethe first action.
237. Answer A is correct. The main cause of death after the immediate post-burn time
frame is sepsis; therefore, preventing infection is a priority for this time period.Answer B would be emphasized earlier, and answer D requires a healed wound beforeit can be implemented. Answer C would be a necessary intervention during care, but itis not the primary focus.
238. Answer B is correct. The nurse should keep the stoma open until a sterile tracheosto-
my can be inserted. Answer A could eliminate the airway, answer C would possiblycontaminate the airway with bacteria, and answer D would not be effective because theairway is via the stoma.
239. Answer B is correct. If there is any bleeding, new bruising, or pain at the puncture
site, the physician should be notified. The information in answers A, C, and D are correct discharge teaching statements, so these answers are incorrect.
240. Answer A is correct. The nurse suspects congestive heart failure and anticipates an
order for a diuretic to remove excess fluid. Answer B has insufficient data to supportthe need. Answer C would increase the client’s fluid volume. Lowering the head, inanswer D, would be an expectation for a client with a fluid volume deficit.Practice Exam 5 and Rationales
40105_0789737043_ch05.qxd  10/29/07  10:20 PM  Page 401
241. Answer A is correct. The suction source should not exceed 120mmHg when perform-
ing trachial suctioning. Answers B, C, and D exceed this amount and could cause
damage to the trachea, so they are incorrect.
242. Answer A is correct. Bleeding at the site requires pressure to stop it. Answers B and
C would be correct actions to take, but eliminating the bleeding process would takepriority. Answer D is an inappropriate action, and the movement could increase thebleeding, so it is incorrect. 
243. Answer B is correct. The systemic analysis of the electrocardiogram shows the infor-
mation in the question as criteria for sinus tachycardia. Answer A would reveal an irregu-lar rhythm and an early or different P wave. Answer C is incorrect because the P waveswould be saw-toothed and the P: QRS ratio would be 2:1, 3:1, or 4:1. Answer D requiresan unidentifiable P wave and a PR interval of less than 0.12 seconds, so it is incorrect. 
244. Answer A is correct. The focus of treatment is to increase the heart rate to maintain
cardiac output. Atropine is the first treatment of choice for this disorder. Answer Btreats atrial arrhythmias, but side effects include bradycardia and heart blocks, whichmakes it incorrect. Answers C and D are used for ventricular arrhythmias.
245. Answer D is correct. Cigarette smoking directly affects the sweeping action of the
cilia, which interferes with the ability to remove mucus and clear the airway. AnswersA and B are accurate statements but do not relate to emphysema. Answer C is not adirect effect of smoking.
246. Answer A is correct. The increase in venous pressure causes the jugular veins to dis-
tend. Other symptoms of right-sided heart failure include ascites, weakness, anorexia,dependent edema, and weight gain. Answers B, C, and D result from the left ventricle’sinability to pump blood out of the ventricle to the body and are specific for left-sided,not right-sided, heart failure. 
247. Answer D is correct. The client might be asked to cough and breathe deeply at certain
times during the procedure. Answer A is incorrect because fluids are encouraged, toincrease urine output and flush out the dye. The client will receive mild to moderatesedation, which makes answer B incorrect. Assessment of the site and pedal pulsesare performed every 15 minutes for the first hour and then every 1–2 hours until puls-es are stable, which makes answer C incorrect.
248. Answer B is correct. Theophylline should be taken with food to prevent GI irritation.
Because this drug can cause tachycardia, answer A is incorrect. The IV drug is amino-phylline and may not be ordered with worsening symptoms, so answer C is incorrect.Answer D is incorrect because the client should continue to take the drug when symp-toms get better.
249. Answer D is correct. The delivery of oxygen is the best measure to correct hypoxia.
Answers A, B, and C should also improve the client’s hypoxia, but oxygen is the pre-scription that would deliver immediate relief.
250. Answer C is correct. Delivering an anticoagulant to a client with a hemorrhagic stroke
is contraindicated because of the likelihood of increasing the bleed and worsening theclient’s condition. Answers A, B, and D are necessary positive treatments for clientswith strokes, so they would not be questioned.402 Chapter 505_0789737043_ch05.qxd  10/29/07  10:20 PM  Page 402
