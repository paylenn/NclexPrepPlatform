            explanation: "Appropriate nursing interventions for a client experiencing hallucinations include acknowledging the client's perceptions while clarifying your own reality, assessing the content of hallucinations to evaluate for safety risks, engaging the client in activities to redirect focus, and maintaining a calm environment to reduce stimuli that may worsen hallucinations. Telling clients their perceptions aren't real or administering medication without discussion is not therapeutic."

Elevated pulse and temperature are expected with infection, and Brudzinski's sign indicates meningeal irritation but not necessarily increased ICP."
