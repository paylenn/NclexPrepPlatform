Where Are We?

Item Development
Measuring Clinical Judgment
Clinical judgment will be measured two ways on the NGN
1.Case Studies: A real -world nursing scenario accompanied by 
multiple test items
2.Standalone Items: Individual items not part of a case study 
Measuring Clinical Judgment
•Standalone items target one or more of the six “Layer 3” 
clinical judgment elements
•Case Studies target multiple elements using a scenario and 
multiple items

Sample NGN Case Study

Close -up view of left -hand side of screen –Scenario
Close -up view of right -hand side of screen –First item
Close -up view of second item
Initial close -up view of third item 
Final close -up view of third item –options visible 
Close -up view of left -hand side of screen –UPDATED Scenario
Close -up view of right --hand side of screen –Fourth item
Close -up view of right -hand side of screen –Fifth item (initial view)
Close -up view of right -hand side of screen –Fifth item (showing candidate response)

Close -up view of sixth and final item
New Item Types
Case studies and standalone items will include several new item 
types introduced specifically for the NGN —
•Highlighting
•Cloze (Pull -Down Menu)
•Matrix/Grid
•Extended Multiple Response
•Trend Item
•Extended Drag and Drop, including Bowtie

Status of Item Development
•Clinical judgment item sets.
•RN work began in 2017. Nearing launch goal.
•PN work began in Jan 2020. Primary focus of current efforts.
•Clinical judgment standalone items.
•In progress for RN and PN.
•Item development is on track to support a 2023 launch.
Scoring
A New Approach to Scoring
•NCLEX Today : A candidate response to an item is either correct or incorrect —
i.e., dichotomous scoring
•Points possible: 0 or 1
•NGN: A candidate response may be partially correct and receive partial 
credit— i.e., polytomous scoring
•Points possible: 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.
Different Types of Polytomous Scoring
Partial credit can be assigned in three 
different ways
•Candidates receive a point for correct 
responses and lose a point for incorrect 
responses. We call this +/-scoring. 
•See example Which of these countries is in North America? 
Select all that apply.
qFrance                      incorrect       -1 point
qMexico                     correct          +1 point
qCanada                     correct          +1 point
qNew Zealand
qUnited States
Using +/-scoring this candidate earns 2 –1 = 1 point 
out of a maximum of 3 points possible (Mexico, 
Canada, United States).
Different Types of Polytomous Scoring
Partial credit can be assigned in three 
different ways
•Candidates receive a point for correct 
responses and lose a point for incorrect 
responses. We call this +/-scoring. 
•Candidates receive a point for correct 
responses but do not lose points for incorrect 
responses. We call this 0/1scoring. 
•See example Which three of these countries are in North America? 
qFrance                      incorrect         0 points
qMexico                     correct          +1 point
qCanada                     correct          +1 point
qNew Zealand
qUnited States
Using 0/1scoring this candidate earns 2 points out of 
a maximum of 3 points possible (Mexico, Canada, 
United States).
Different Types of Polytomous Scoring
Partial credit can be assigned in three 
different ways
•Candidates receive a point for correct 
responses and lose a point for incorrect 
responses. We call this +/-scoring. 
•Candidates receive a point for correct 
responses but do not lose points for incorrect 
responses. We call this 0/1scoring. 
•Candidates receive “all or nothing” credit for 
linked units within an item.
•See exampleDrag and drop the tokens below to complete the 
paragraph correctly.

PARAGRAPH
The capital of                                 is                                .

The candidate earns 1 point for France/Paris pair but 
no points for Egypt/Japan. In this example country 
and city are linked for scoring. Total score: 1 point.Paris Okinawa TokyoJapan Cairo Egypt

Benefits of Partial Credit Scoring
•Partial credit scoring allows for more precise measurement and is 
appropriate to the complexity of the new item types
•Having multiple ways to assign partial credit, such as +/ -, reduces 
impact of random guessing or “gaming the items”
Test Design
NGN Test Design
What is meant by NGN Test Design?
•How long is the exam (hours/minutes)?
•How long is the exam (items)?
•What is the mix of current knowledge items and new Clinical Judgment 
items?
•How will items and case studies be selected for delivery?
NGN Test Design
Length of exam will vary by candidate ability
•Minimum Length Exam –Candidates with very low or very high ability estimates
•3 scored case studies (18 items)
•52 scored knowledge items
•TOTAL: 70 scored items + 15 unscored (pretest) items
•Maximum Length Exam –Candidates with ability estimates very close to cut score
•3 scored case studies (18 items)
•117 other scored items –Most will be knowledge items but ~10% will be Clinical Judgement standalone 
items
•TOTAL: 135 scored items + 15 unscored (pretest) items
•Candidates will have up to 5 hours (more if time accommodations apply) to complete the exam

Beta Testing
Beta Testing
•End- to-end testing of all elements of NGN prior to launch
•Registration/scheduling
•Test publication and administration
•Functioning of items and case studies (e.g., presentation, scoring)
•Functioning of CAT algorithm (selection, stopping rules)
•Pass/fail decision
•Data and reports
•Follows the “alpha testing” of individual elements that occurs as they are 
developed
Two phases
•“Friends and Family” (est. April 2022)
•Participants selected by NCSBN
•Will include NRB staff and other stakeholders but not actual students/candidates
•Administered at PPCs similar to today’s Member Board Reviews
•Review of maximum length exam
•“Live” Beta Test (est. December 2022)
•Participants will be nursing students expecting to graduate after April 2023
•Fully functional exam but scoring/results will not count
•Reports generated but for internal NCSBN QC only
