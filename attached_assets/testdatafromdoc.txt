Maryland NextGen Testbank: Medical SurgicalMini-Review
This review uses items in the Maryland NextGen Test Bank accessed with a Qualtrics link or QR Code.
The Maryland Testbank contains peer-reviewed items written by faculty across the State of Maryland that attempt to align with publicly available information about Next Generation NCLEX.
The Maryland NextGen Test Bank Project was funded by the Maryland Nursing Workforce Center as part of a grant from the Maryland Higher Education Commission Nurse Support Program II # 20-125. 
This review will take approximately 4 to 5 hours to complete.

About The NextGen NCLEX
Starting April 1, 2023,  graduates will take an updated version of the National Council Licensure Exam referred to as Next Generation NCLEX.
Next Generation NCLEX (NGN) will continue to test a candidate’s ability to provide safe client care while incorporating new methods to better test clinical judgment.   
The testing methods will include using new item response types in clinical judgment case studies and stand-alone questions to test the NCSBN Clinical Judgment Measurement Model(NCJMM) (https://www.ncsbn.org/exams/next-generation-nclex/NGN+Resources/clinical-judgment-measurement-model.page)

Extended multiple response items with increased answer options. 
Drag-and-drop items that involve moving options to placeholders.
Drop-down items where candidates select the missing words from sentences, paragraphs, or tables.
Highlight items that require candidates to identify parts of the medical record to answer questions. 
Matrix/grid items that involve completing tables of information.

The Five New Item Response Types
Unfolding case studies use approved NGN item types to answer questions about evolving real-world nursing scenarios.
Case studies present 6 linked questions to test the 6 steps of the NCJMM in order:
Recognize cues
Analyze cues
Prioritize hypotheses 
Generate solutions
Take action
Evaluate outcomes
Candidates should expect to complete 3 to 5 case studies in a minimum length 85 question NCLEX exam. 
Case Studies
Stand-alone (single) items test either client needs or clinical judgment
Client needs items test knowledge of the 8 client needs using traditional or new item types.  
Clinical judgment items present information in a clinical scenario specifically targeting one or more NCJMM clinical judgment step.
There are 2 unique types of clinical judgment stand-alone items: 
Bow-tie 
Trend  
Clinical judgment stand-alone items make up approximately 10% of stand-alone items.

Stand-alone Item Types
A bowtie is a drag-and-drop response item variation.  
After reading a clinical scenario, candidates move response options (tokens) to placeholders (targets).
On NCLEX the placeholders are arranged in the shape of a bowtie.
Candidates must select:
1 condition the client is most likely experiencing from 4 options.
2 actions to take to address the condition from 5 options.
2 parameters to monitor the client’s progress from 5 options. 

Stand-alone Item: Bowtie
Bowties in Qualtrics
Bowties in Qualtrics are 3 drop and drag question- but they don’t make a “bowtie” shape. 
Trend items require the candidate to make clinical judgments based on client data presented at different time points.
 Trend items may address one or more clinical judgment steps but do not follow the six-item sequence like case studies do.
 Trend items can feature any item response type except bowtie.


Stand-alone Item: Trends
Your instructor will provide a QR code or link to answer a series of case studies, bowtie items and trends across a lifespan 
While questions throughout the test bank use all 5 new item response, not all specific variations that might be used on NCLEX are not included such as drop-down items formatted as a table.
Information needed to answer questions will be displayed in a medical record, but the medical record will display differently on the actual NCLEX.

+/-. This  question is worth 5 points.
Give yourself 1 point for each correct response AND  subtract 1 point for every incorrect answer you picked. The worst you can score is 0. 
Screen 1 of 6
Rationale
Primary signs of compartment syndrome include the “5 P’s,” Pain (out of proportion/not relieved with pain medication), Pallor, Pulses (diminished or absent), Paresthesia, Paralysis. Additionally, fullness, cool or cold extremity, and weakness may occur. Any of these symptoms are indicative of neurovascular compromise. If untreated could result in tissue death and loss of limb. The pedal pulse will not be able to be assessed due to the cast. 

0/1. This  question is worth 6 points. Give yourself a point for each row you got right. 
Screen 2 of 6
Rationale
 The nurse should differentiate between acute complications of a fracture and chronic or late complications. Acute complications include deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, fat embolism, and compartment syndrome. Late, or chronic complications include complex regional pain syndrome, avascular necrosis, osteomyelitis, and delayed union. 

Rationale. This  question is worth 1 point
Give yourself 1 point only if you answered BOTH parts correctly
Screen 3 of 6
Rationale
Compartment syndrome is suspected based on the abnormal findings in the neurovascular assessment. While some of the vital signs are abnormal, and the client is tachycardic there can be causes other than compartment syndrome for these findings.

Nursing- 3 points 
Medications – 2 point
Collaborative- 1 point
Screen 4 of 6
Rationale
The nurse should prioritize interventions that would relieve pressure within the compartment, monitor for improving or declining condition, and treat potential life or limb threatening conditions. This would include frequent neurovascular assessments and preparing to remove the cast as soon as possible by getting the cast removal saw to the bedside. The provider is likely to insert a compartment pressure measurement manometer to assess compartmental pressures. Client should be kept NPO in the event surgery is required. Pain medication such as morphine is indicated, and due to hypotension an IV fluid bolus is indicated. Ibuprofen is not effective for the pain rate of 10/10, and 400 mg would not be a therapeutic dose. Aspirin is contraindicated due to the anticoagulation component if the client needs surgery. The surgical team should be consulted. Client would not be instructed on crutch walking at this time until the compartment syndrome is resolved. Respiratory and Case Management for long-term care are not indicated at this time.
The
+/-. This item is worth 5 points. Give yourself 1 point for every correct option you picked AND subtract 1 point for every incorrect item you selected. The worst you can score is 0. 
Screen  5 of 6
Rationale
 To accomplish all the tasks needed to care for this client the nurse may delegate some tasks to  the UAP. The UAP is unable to perform assessments or monitor neurovascular status. t is the nurses’ responsibility to ensure client is ready for surgery. The pre-operative checklist may be used to ensure all pre-operative criteria is met. Measuring and documenting VS, Intake and Output, height and weight may all be done by the UAP. The UAP may also help the client to maintain the extremity in the proper position as instructed by the Nurse.

Give yourself 1 point for each correct response.
Screen 1 of 6
Rationale
The most concerning signs are dyspnea which indicates hepatopulmonary syndrome from worsening ascites, as well as a decline in neurologic function (drowsy off and on, oriented to name only, slightly agitated, etc.). BUN slightly elevated but due to dehydration vs. acute kidney failure as creatinine is normal. A low serum albumin level is expected due to cirrhosis and malnourished condition from alcohol use disorder.

Screen 2 of 6
Rationale
 Ascites (a complication of portal hypertension and low albumin from cirrhosis/liver damage) can result in respiratory compromise while deterioration in neurologic status (confusion and agitation) results from increased ammonia levels causing hepatic encephalopathy.
Rationale. This  question is worth 1 point.
Give yourself 1 point only if you answered BOTH parts correctly
Screen 3 of 6
Rationale
Hepatic encephalopathy is a common complication of cirrhosis and is caused by inability of the liver to detoxify protein by-products. This results in increased ammonia levels which can be toxic to the CNS.  Abnormal neurological findings which are common indicators of hepatic encephalopathy include confusion, lethargy, dozing on and off, restlessness and agitation.

Screen 4 of 6
Rationale
Interventions  are focused on treating both ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. Acetaminophen and sedatives are contraindicated as is placing the client flat in bed when dyspneic due to ascites. Glucose monitoring would not harm the client but is not necessary.

Rationale
 The trends in the heart rate, blood pressure, and pulse oximeter reading are consistent with shock and the confusion may be a symptom of of poor cerebral perfusions.  The urine was only slightly red but is now once again bright red suggesting the bleeding is getting worse. The client needs oxygen and a fluid bolus to improve perfusion. Urine and the blood pressure should be monitored for resolution of the hypotension and bleeding.

Screen 1 of 6
Rationale
An ECG of sinus tachycardia with ST segment elevation indicates there is damage to the cardiac muscle and should be addressed immediately. Elevated troponin T is specific for myocardial injury. Creatine kinase-MB can be used as a test for myocardial cell death but is also commonly found in other sites, so it is not specific to the myocardium. The cholesterol is elevated but not diagnostic for a myocardial infarction. Platelets and white blood cell counts are normal.

Screen 2 of 6
Rationale
Obesity, elevated cholesterol, and crushing chest pain are associated with all  three acute coronary syndromes. Cardiac biomarkers are not elevated with unstable angina. The EKG findings show ST elevation which indicates significant cardiac damage associated with an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Rationale. This  question is worth 1 point.
Give yourself 1 point only if you answered BOTH parts correctly.
Screen 3 of 6
Rationale
The client’s labs and symptoms are congruent with STEMI. STEMI occurs when there is sudden rupture of an unstable part of the wall in a heart artery followed by the build- up of a clot in an attempt to heal it. This clot formation results in total blockage of the artery and loss of blood supply to the heart. 

0/1. This  question is worth 6 points. Give yourself 1 point for each row you got correct.
Screen 4 of 6
Rationale
Acute care for STEMI includes pain management, establishing perfusion, and limiting ischemic damage. Analgesics, typically morphine, are given for pain. Ischemia is limited by decreasing perfusion needs.  Beta blockers can be given to control lower heart rate and blood pressure. Reperfusion therapy can be medical or manual. Medical therapy includes giving a fibrinolytic to dissolve any blood clots that may be present blocking blood vessels. Anti- coagulants prevent worsening obstruction. Fluid boluses would increase cardiac load. There is no evidence of infection to need antibiotics.

The blood pressure,  pulse oximeter, and pain level have all improved after the client received oxygen per nasal cannula, nitroglycerin, morphine, and tenecteplase. The client’s heart rate has increased, this could be an indicator of the heart muscle attempting to pump more oxygenated blood to the tissues. The client’s respiratory rate is unchanged.

Rationale
 The vital signs, absent breath sounds, and tracheal deviations indicate the client is developing a tension pneumothorax. The nurse should call the rapid response team to administer emergency treatment to the client, such as inserting a chest tube.  A stat chest Xray can help confirm the diagnosis. Improved respiratory status and improved hemodynamic status(blood pressure/pulse) are the best indicators the tension pneumothorax is resolved. Pain may stay elevated because of rib fractures. Blood gases are obtained as needed. If the respiratory improves another blood gas may not be needed after treatment.

Rationale
Serum blood glucose levels in diabetic ketoacidosis can fluctuate between 300 and 800mg/dl. It is typically above 600 mg/dL with HHS. Low pH and urine ketones are seen with DKA. Those values are typically normal with HHS. Both conditions can cause dehydration and elevated creatine.  

0/1. This  question is worth 1 point.
Give yourself 1 point if you answered correctly.
Screen 3 of 6
Rationale
The priority for care is to restore volume so the client has adequate perfusion. Once the volume is improved, insulin therapy can begin to slowly bring the glucose down. The client will be monitored to determine if the acidosis is getting worse, giving sodium bicarbonate is not done unless the pH is <6.9 

0/1. This  question is worth 6 points. Give yourself 1 point for each row you got correct. 
Screen 4 of 6
Rationale
The nurse monitors fingerstick glucoses. The glycosylated hemoglobin A1C is not a good indicator to determine the effectiveness of treatment. Pursed-lipped breathing will help slow the pace of breathing. Treatment for DKA is with regular insulin, not glargine, because it can be given IV and titrated to slowly achieve goals. The client's urine output should be measured with a urinal. Clients with diabetes have a high risk of developing infections and a high risk of delayed healing time, thereby an indwelling catheter poses a greater risk for infection. Cardiovascular changes can be observed with mild acidosis. Prolonged and untreated acidosis can lead to the onset of hyperkalemia. The heart rate will decrease, T waves become tall and peaked, and the QRS complex widens. Conversely, hypokalemia can result with insulin therapy; potassium replacement is initiated when serum levels fall below the normal range. 
The
+/-. This item is worth 4 points. Give yourself 1 point for every correct option selected AND subtract 1 point for each incorrect option selected. The worst you can score is 0. 
Screen  5 of 6
Rationale
Hypokalemia can result with insulin therapy. Insulin is typically held if levels fall below 3.3mEq/L. Dextrose is added to IV fluids when glucose levels stabilize to prevent hypoglycemia. Clients can eat when their respiratory status is stable, and they feel like eating. During the initial phase of treating the client for DKA, the nurse should  monitor the client’s status to prevent the onset of fluid overload. The client weighs 93 kg so based on orders the starting rate would be 9.3 Units/hr.

+/-. This item is worth 3 points. Give yourself 1 point for every correct option selected AND subtract 1 point for each incorrect option selected. The worst you can score is 0. 

Screen  6 of 6
Rationale
Treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis focuses on managing and correcting the serum glucose along with correcting dehydration, electrolyte imbalances and acidosis. With the administration of the intravenous fluids and the insulin infusion, the accumulated ketone bodies are reversed, thereby correcting the acidotic state, and ending the production of ketones from the fat breakdown. Reversal of the ketone production and correction of the fluid and electrolyte imbalance, the compensatory mechanisms are stimulated. The blood pressure will increase, and the heart rate will decrease. With the cells being rehydrated and glucose moving into the cells, the client's neurological status should improve. Pain was not a primary issue and breath sounds were clear to start. The blood glucose has  not yet begun to decrease.

Rationale
 The client’s hemodynamic status is stabilizing with fairly consistent heart and blood pressure measurements. The temperature also as remained fairly stable.  Urine output of 50 mL an hour is a sign of improved renal perfusion. Stridor and decreased pulse oximeter readings suggest the development of upper airway edema.

Rationale
The client is experiencing a COPD exacerbation. Placing the client in a high fowler’s position and encouraging the use of the incentive spirometer will assist in maximizing the client’s lung expansion and improving ventilatory efforts. Administering ipratropium bromide and albuterol and methylprednisolone can assist in alleviating airway narrowing and inflammation caused by the client’s exacerbated symptoms. Placing a client with a known history of COPD on high-flow oxygen can induce carbon dioxide narcosis. Administering ondansetron is not indicated unless in this case since the client does not have nausea and/or vomiting.

Rationale
IV methylprednisolone is ordered now and will help reduce inflammation to improve ease of breathing. The antibiotic should be given after the neb treatment.  Albuterol was just given. The client would need to be reassessed to determine if another dose is needed PRN. The client is verbalizing 0 out of 10 pain,  so acetaminophen is not necessary at this time

Rationale
The client’s respiratory rate, breath sounds, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure have all declined despite the nurse administering  ordered medications.  The client is no longer exhibiting expiratory wheezing upon auscultation. The client’s temperature remains unchanged. The nurse should promptly alert the provider as the client’s respiratory symptoms are rapidly deteriorating.

Rationale
 The client is experiencing an acute thyroid storm that requires administration of anti-hyperthyroid drugs such as methimazole. In order to help decrease the client’s metabolic demands, the nurse should promote a calm and restful care environment. Cooling methods and Intravenous fluids are also needed. Monitoring the client’s body temperature, and serum thyroid levels are all important parameters to monitor in a client experiencing a thyroid storm. Daily weights and monitoring the client’s sleeping habits and WBC’s level are not effective in assessing the individual client’s progress.

Rationale
Fever, abdominal pain, elevated WBC in the serum and dialysate effluent are indications of peritonitis, a potentially life-threatening complication of peritoneal dialysis. Although the BUN and creatinine are high for an individual without renal failure, these values are typical of a client with end stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. The blood pressure and heart rate are only slightly elevated, so are not a priority at this time. The respiratory rate is within normal range for an adult. Erythema and creamy, yellow exudate around the peritoneal dialysis catheter exit site indicate the possible presence of an exit site infection, which may be the source of the peritonitis.

Screen 2 of 6
Rationale
C-reactive protein is an inflammatory marker and is elevated in the presence of infection and inflammation. BUN, creatinine, and potassium imbalances are common in clients with ESRD associated with the inability of the client’s kidneys to excrete waste products. Anemia is indicated by the low hemoglobin and hematocrit. This is a result of the kidney’s inability to produce erythropoietin in client’s with ESRD. Elevated WBC and neutrophil levels are diagnostic of infection.

0/1. This  question is worth 1 point.
Give yourself 1 point if you answered correctly.
Screen 3 of 6
Rationale
Approximately 11% of ESRD patients with peritonitis develop sepsis. Sepsis is a general term used to characterize an immune system response to an infection. In sepsis the chemicals from the body's own defenses trigger inflammatory responses, which can impair blood flow to organs, like the brain or heart. This in turn can lead to organ failure and tissue damage. At its most severe, the body's response to infection can cause dangerously low blood pressure, a sign of septic shock. The mortality from septic shock is about 33%.

Screen 4 of 6
Rationale
Rationale for “Not Appropriate”: IVF: D5 ½ NS with 20mEq/l KCl at 120 ml/hr is not appropriate as client’s with ESRD are oliguric or anuric and this would place the client at risk for developing hypervolemia and hyperkalemia. Vancomycin is not effective against gram-negative pathogens. Unless the patient is septic, antibiotics should be infused intraperitoneally for peritonitis in clients with ESRD on peritoneal dialysis. Enoxaparin is not appropriate in clients with ESRD. This medication is excreted renally, so clients with ESRD cannot clear the medication, leading to a high risk of bleeding.
Rationale for “Appropriate”: A daily weight is needed to assess for hypervolemia associated with ESRD. Inflammation of the peritoneum associated with peritonitis may interfere with the efficacy of peritoneal dialysis. Blood cultures are needed to assess for potential bacteremia. Clients with bacteremia may need IV antibiotics in addition to intra-peritoneal antibiotics. PD catheter care is needed to treat the infection. The catheter may need to be removed and reinserted if the infection does not clear. Gentamicin is a good broad-spectrum antibiotic that treats gram-negative bacteria. Once culture results are received, the antibiotic should be adjusted based on sensitivity results. Intra-peritoneal delivery is more effective than IV for peritonitis. Epoetin alfa is used to treat anemia associated with ESRD. In clients with ESRD, the kidneys do not produce enough erythropoietin to stimulate red blood cell production. Calcium carbonate, a phosphate binders must be taken with each meal to prevent the absorption of phosphorus from the gut. Keeping serum phosphate levels within the normal range will prevent serum phosphorus from binding with serum calcium, which lowers the calcium level.

Rationale
The UAP provides basic care skills such as hygiene, and collects limited assessment data, such as vital signs and weights. The LPN can perform nursing care in “routine” nursing situations. They can provide non-complicated wound care. They cannot implement “non-routine” care such as administering antibiotics intraperitoneally, providing catheter care teaching or performing a dialysate exchange for a client on peritoneal dialysis. Those tasks must be done by the RN.

Rationale
Clients should not pick or remove crusts or scabs at the exit site before washing the site. This could tear the skin and increase the risk for site infection. Clients should clean the catheter exit site with a liquid antibacterial soap and a clean cloth. Antiseptics can dry and crack the skin, increasing the risk of infection. The exit site should not be left open to air. It should be covered with sterile gauze, which should be changed every time the site is cleaned.

A disruption of the blood supply to brain areas leads to a sudden loss of motor function. Like a myocardial infarction or heart attack, a disruption of blood flow to the brain is a medical emergency that requires immediate and intentional interventions. Lightheadedness, weakness of the left lower and upper extremity, sudden headache, elevated heart rate, elevated blood pressure, denotes poor cerebral perfusion and requires immediate follow up.

Rationale
Efforts to reduce the onset of stroke remain a focal point for healthcare providers. A healthy lifestyle that addresses modifiable risk factors such as physical activity (40 minutes per day, 3 – 4 days/week), alcohol consumption in moderation, and healthy eating practices can reduce the onset of a stroke. Age, race, and gender are nonmodifiable risk factors for a stroke. African Americans and some Hispanic/Latino Americans have a higher stroke and mortality when compared to Caucasian Americans. Combined hormonal contraceptive is a birth control that contains estrogen to prevent ovulation by altering the cervical mucus and uterine lining. Exogenous estrogens impact the skeletal, metabolic, and coagulation systems, thereby increasing the risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack. Vape contains nicotine as an active ingredient and increases the risk of developing a blood clot, stroke, or heart attack while using estrogen.

Rationale
An interruption of blood flow to the brain because of a thrombotic or embolic event can lead to the onset of an ischemic stroke.  The main nursing priority with a client experiencing an ischemic stroke is to restore cerebral perfusion to prevent further neurological deficits, altered level of consciousness, or death of the cells.

Screen 4 of 6
Rationale
Thrombolytic therapy, alteplase or recombinant t-Pa, dissolves the clot and is used once an ischemic stroke is determined. Dose is weight dependent. A thorough assessment to diagnose stroke and initiating thrombolytic therapy within 3 hours lessens the stroke's magnitude and improves the brain's overall function and outcomes three months after the stroke. Contraindications to thrombolytic treatment include but are not limited to if symptoms started longer ago than 3-hours, having a major surgical procedure within the last 14 days, current pregnancy, blood glucose less than 50 mg/dL, and receiving heparin in the past 48 hours.

0/1. This item is worth 7 points. Give yourself 1 point for every row you answered correctly. 
Screen  5 of 6
Rationale
Clients who receive thrombolytic therapy are admitted to an intensive care unit for continuous cardiac monitoring and close observation for bleeding; therefore, oral anticoagulants are withheld for the next 24 hours. Insertion of nasogastric tubes, urinary catheters, and intra-arterial pressure catheters is delayed for 24 hours. Vital signs are recorded and documented every 15 minutes for the first two hours, then every 30 minutes for the next six hours, and then every hour until 24 hours after treatment to monitor for intracerebral hemorrhage and other signs of bleeding. Serum glucose blood levels should be assessed and maintained within 140 to 180 mg/dL. Efforts to reduce hypoglycemia are also significant. Poor neurological outcomes in acute stroke have been associated with hyperglycemia.

Screen  6 of 6
Rationale
Thrombolytic agents are designed to dissolve the thrombi to help reestablish blood flow to reduce injury and death of the neural cells. Like other anticoagulant agents, the risk of bleeding is a significant adverse effect. To prevent a fall, the nurse should instruct the client to call someone to help her get out of bed. An ischemic stroke can cause dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) due to impairment of the mouth, tongue, palate, larynx, pharynx, and upper esophagus, therefore, a swallow evaluation should be completed within 4 to 24 hours. The speech and swallow evaluation will determine if the client should have thin or thicken liquids or pureed foods to prevent aspiration. The client should take the necessary precaution to reduce bleeding by switching to an electric razor or brushing their teeth with a soft bristle toothbrush to reduce bleeding at the gumline. Combined hormonal contraception contains the estrogen hormone that influences fibrinogen in the plasma, specifically factor VII and X, thereby increasing the risk of stroke, bleeding, and heart attack. The client should inquire about other alternatives to prevent pregnancy. A baseline assessment of the client’s functional ability is important to determine the motor, social, and cognitive function. This assessment is completed by the nurse. The client should plan to take apixaban, an oral anticoagulant used to treat and prevent blood clots to prevent a stroke. Clients with type II diabetes should plan to monitor their blood glucose and if indicated self-administer insulin as prescribed.

Rationale
 The client is experiencing infection of the surgical site which can be identified through yellow drainage on the surgical bandage, increased pain, and increased WBC count. 
The nurse would want to administer acetaminophen to reduce the fever and remove the bandage to assess the surgical site to view for other signs of infection. Reinforcing the surgical dressing is not appropriate, as the nurse would want to remove the bandage to assess the incision. Administering ibuprofen for fever is contraindicated in a client with spinal surgery due to increased risk of bleeding. It is not necessary to empty the JP drain as there is only 10 mL of output. 
The nurse would want to monitor the client’s temperature to assess the response to Tylenol and monitor the client’s WBC as it will indicate improvement of worsening of the infection. The client’s neurologic status, respiratory rate, and blood pressure are currently stable and are not the top priority.

Maryland NextGen Testbank: FundamentalsMini-Review
This review uses items in the Maryland NextGen Test Bank accessed with a Qualtrics link or QR Code.
The Maryland Testbank contains peer-reviewed items written by faculty across the State of Maryland that attempt to align with publicly available information about Next Generation NCLEX.
The Maryland NextGen Test Bank Project was funded by the Maryland Nursing Workforce Center as part of a grant from the Maryland Higher Education Commission Nurse Support Program II # 20-125. 
This review will take approximately 1.5 to 2 hours to complete.
For best result, use a laptop, notebook, or desktop to answer the questions.

About The NextGen NCLEX
Starting April 1, 2023,  graduates will take an updated version of the National Council Licensure Exam referred to as Next Generation NCLEX.
Next Generation NCLEX (NGN) will continue to test a candidate’s ability to provide safe client care while incorporating new methods to better test clinical judgment.   
The testing methods will include using new item response types in clinical judgment case studies and stand-alone questions to test the NCSBN Clinical Judgment Measurement Model(NCJMM) (https://www.ncsbn.org/exams/next-generation-nclex/NGN+Resources/clinical-judgment-measurement-model.page)

Extended multiple response items with increased answer options. 
Drag-and-drop items that involve moving options to placeholders.
Drop-down items where candidates select the missing words from sentences, paragraphs, or tables.
Highlight items that require candidates to identify parts of the medical record to answer questions. 
Matrix/grid items that involve completing tables of information.

The Five New Item Response Types
Unfolding case studies use approved NGN item types to answer questions about evolving real-world nursing scenarios.
Case studies present 6 linked questions to test the 6 steps of the NCJMM in order:
Recognize cues
Analyze cues
Prioritize hypotheses 
Generate solutions
Take action
Evaluate outcomes
Candidates should expect to complete 3 to 5 case studies in a minimum length 85 question NCLEX exam. 
Case Studies
Stand-alone (single) items test either client needs or clinical judgment
Client needs items test knowledge of the 8 client needs using traditional or new item types.  
Clinical judgment items present information in a clinical scenario specifically targeting one or more NCJMM clinical judgment step.
There are 2 unique types of clinical judgment stand-alone items: 
Bowtie 
Trend  
Clinical judgment stand-alone items make up approximately 10% of stand-alone items.

Stand-alone Item Types
A bowtie is a drag-and-drop response item variation.  
After reading a clinical scenario, candidates move response options (tokens) to placeholders (targets).
On NCLEX the placeholders are arranged in the shape of a bowtie.
Candidates must select:
1 condition the client is most likely experiencing from 4 options.
2 actions to take to address the condition from 5 options.
2 parameters to monitor the client’s progress from 5 options. 

Stand-alone Item: Bowtie
Bowties in Qualtrics
Bowties in Qualtrics are 3 drop and drag question- but they don’t make a “bowtie” shape. 
Trend items require the candidate to make clinical judgments based on client data presented at different time points.
 Trend items may address one or more clinical judgment steps but do not follow the six-item sequence like case studies do.
 Trend items can feature any item response type except bowtie.


Stand-alone Item: Trends
Your instructor will provide a QR code or link to answer a series of case studies, bowtie items and trends across a lifespan 
While questions throughout the test bank use all 5 new item response, not all specific variations that might be used on NCLEX are not included such as drop-down items formatted as a table.
Information needed to answer questions will be displayed in a medical record, but the medical record will display differently on the actual NCLEX.

Rationale
The nurse should identify signs and symptoms of post-operative complications that need to be addressed.  Signs of atelectasis include increased heart rate, increased respirations, breathing difficulties and low oxygen levels.  Breath sounds will be diminished due to collapsed alveoli.  Blood pressure is not affected unless it becomes elevated due to the stress of breathing difficulties.  Pain medication is important but first the breathing issues must be addressed.

Screen 2 of 6
Rationale
 The nurse should differentiate signs and symptoms of atelectasis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and fluid overload in clients with respiratory distress following surgery. All respiratory issues include shortness of breath and increased respirations, and decreased pulse oximeter readings. Diminished breath sounds and repressed coughing are most associated with post-op atelectasis. Coughing, rhonchi, wheezing, or crackles would be expected with the other three conditions.  Low-grade fever and normal and stable blood pressures would be expected with atelectasis and pneumonia. Fever could also be higher with pneumonia.  Unstable blood pressures would be expected for pulmonary embolism or fluid overload. Hypotension is typically seen with pulmonary embolism. Hypertension is associated with fluid overload.

Screen 4 of 6
Rationale
The XRAY confirms atelectasis. Proper nursing interventions include sitting the client up to aid with breathing.  Supine position can make breathing more difficult.  Applying oxygen via nasal cannula can also make breathing easier.  Using the incentive spirometer can also make breathing easier. Controlling pain improves compliance with incentive spirometry.  Extra fluid does not help a client with breathing and can put the client at risk for fluid overload.  A CBC is not necessary for monitoring atelectasis as it would be for detecting and infection.

Screen  5 of 6
Rationale
    The nurse should teach the client with atelectasis interventions that can improve their oxygenation.   The nurse can instruct the client to be out of bed and ambulate, to take deep breaths in order to increase lung capacity and open up the alveoli.  The incentive spirometer can also help improve lung function.  The client should increase the fluids to about 3,000 ml /day to thin mucous secretions and use pain medication so they can take deep breaths.

Breath sounds were diminished on left and make take several cycles of deep breathing and coughing to improve. The increasing fever would indicate that the client’s condition had declined, and an infection may now be present.

Screen  5 of 6
Rationale
The client likely has CAUTI. Sending a C&S will determine 1) if there is an infection and 2) if the appropriate antibiotic is prescribed. Removing the catheter eliminates the mode of transmission and helps to restore the body’s natural flushing out of bacteria. Increased fluid intake will also help to flush out the bacteria. The full course of antibiotics should be taken even if symptoms resolve. The nurse should monitor the client’s voiding pattern to identify potential urinary retention. Evaluation for dementia is not necessary as the client likely had delirium because of the UTI. The client should void when the urge is felt as bacteria can multiply when holding urine.

0/1. This item is worth 7 points. Give yourself 1 point for every row you got right. 
Screen  6 of 6
Rationale
The client should drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day to flush bacteria out of the urinary system. Cotton enhances ventilation of the perineal area and helps prevent accumulation of perineal moisture with facilitates bacterial growth. The bacteria present in bath water can readily enter the urethra. The full course of clindamycin should be finished even if symptoms resolve. The client should practice frequent voiding to flush bacteria out of the urethra and prevent organisms from ascending into the bladder. The use of harsh soaps, bubble bath, powder, or sprays in the perineal areas should be avoided. These substances can be irritating to the urethra and encourage inflammation and bacterial infection. Burning with urination is not normal. It may indicate recurrence of UTI.

Rationale
 When reviewing the assessment findings, the nurse should understand that sudden shortness of breath, low oxygen saturation levels, coughing up blood, increased heart rate, and low blood pressure are consistent with signs of a pulmonary embolism. A pulmonary embolism is a serious medical emergency that can be life threatening. In a pulmonary embolism a dislodged blood clot travels to the pulmonary artery. There is no change to the client’s capillary refill or leg cramping since day 5. The client’s calf size has improved.

The client is not ready for extended care facility placement. Flexibility exercises, such as yoga or tai chi, will help promote range-of-motions and balance. Home physical therapy will help maintain strength and flexibility. A bedside commode will enable the client to use the toilet without climbing stairs. Exploring activities of interest and allowing the client time to respond to questions will help keep client engaged and prevent social isolation.
A fluid restriction is not indicated, based on signs of dehydration. Promoting as much independence as possible in self-care is important to client self-esteem. Due to client’s decreased strength and orthostatic hypotension, he should be encouraged to use the walker when ambulating.

Screen  5 of 6
Rationale
 Clients with Parkinson’s disease should be encouraged to participate in self-care for as long as possible. This helps with both motor skills and self-esteem. Lisinopril can cause orthostatic hypotension, so instruction on standing up slowly is important. Wearing socks on the wood floor increases the risk for falls. Instead, the client should always wear shoes. Making the toilet more accessible is a healthier option to decreasing fluid because dehydration can contribute to the risk for falls. Weightlifting is not considered a safe activity for clients with decreased strength.   Focus on flexibility and stretching is more beneficial that strength training in Parkinson’s disease. Using the bedside commode is a safety intervention to prevent the use of stairs when unattended. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive degenerative disease that will not be cured by medication. Carbidopa/levodopa can help with symptoms of shakiness and trouble moving, but will not prevent disease progression.

Rationale
Changes in cognition such as confusion and irritability and declining speech capability are signs of progressing disease. No fall shows in 3 months shows interventions have been effective. Joining a support group  and an online yoga class demonstrate an understanding of disease progression and positive interventions. The client was using a walker and had dizziness upon standing at the initial visit.

Maryland NextGen Testbank: Comprehensive Mini-Review
This review uses items in the Maryland NextGen Test Bank accessed with a Qualtrics link or QR Code.
The Maryland Testbank contains peer-reviewed items written by faculty across the State of Maryland that attempt to align with publicly available information about Next Generation NCLEX.
The Maryland NextGen Test Bank Project was funded by the Maryland Nursing Workforce Center as part of a grant from the Maryland Higher Education Commission Nurse Support Program II # 20-125. 
This review will take approximately 2.5 to 3 hours to complete.
For best result, use a laptop, notebook, or desktop to answer the questions.

About The NextGen NCLEX
Starting April 1, 2023,  graduates will take an updated version of the National Council Licensure Exam referred to as Next Generation NCLEX.
Next Generation NCLEX (NGN) will continue to test a candidate’s ability to provide safe client care while incorporating new methods to better test clinical judgment.   
The testing methods will include using new item response types in clinical judgment case studies and stand-alone questions to test the NCSBN Clinical Judgment Measurement Model(NCJMM) (https://www.ncsbn.org/exams/next-generation-nclex/NGN+Resources/clinical-judgment-measurement-model.page)

Extended multiple response items with increased answer options. 
Drag-and-drop items that involve moving options to placeholders.
Drop-down items where candidates select the missing words from sentences, paragraphs, or tables.
Highlight items that require candidates to identify parts of the medical record to answer questions. 
Matrix/grid items that involve completing tables of information.

The Five New Item Response Types
Unfolding case studies use approved NGN item types to answer questions about evolving real-world nursing scenarios.
Case studies present 6 linked questions to test the 6 steps of the NCJMM in order:
Recognize cues
Analyze cues
Prioritize hypotheses 
Generate solutions
Take action
Evaluate outcomes
Candidates should expect to complete 3 to 5 case studies in a minimum length 85 question NCLEX exam. 
Case Studies
Stand-alone (single) items test either client needs or clinical judgment
Client needs items test knowledge of the 8 client needs using traditional or new item types.  
Clinical judgment items present information in a clinical scenario specifically targeting one or more NCJMM clinical judgment step.
There are 2 unique types of clinical judgment stand-alone items: 
Bow-tie 
Trend  
Clinical judgment stand-alone items make up approximately 10% of stand-alone items.

Stand-alone Item Types
A bowtie is a drag-and-drop response item variation.  
After reading a clinical scenario, candidates move response options (tokens) to placeholders (targets).
On NCLEX the placeholders are arranged in the shape of a bowtie.
Candidates must select:
1 condition the client is most likely experiencing from 4 options.
2 actions to take to address the condition from 5 options.
2 parameters to monitor the client’s progress from 5 options. 

Stand-alone Item: Bowtie
Bowties in Qualtrics
Bowties in Qualtrics are 3 drop and drag question- but they don’t make a “bowtie” shape. 
Trend items require the candidate to make clinical judgments based on client data presented at different time points.
 Trend items may address one or more clinical judgment steps but do not follow the six-item sequence like case studies do.
 Trend items can feature any item response type except bowtie.


Stand-alone Item: Trends
Your instructor will provide a QR code or link to answer a series of case studies, bowtie items and trends across a lifespan 
While questions throughout the test bank use all 5 new item response, not all specific variations that might be used on NCLEX are not included such as drop-down items formatted as a table.
Information needed to answer questions will be displayed in a medical record, but the medical record will display differently on the actual NCLEX.

0/1. This  question is worth 4 points.
Give yourself 1 point for each correct response. 
Screen 1 of 6
Rationale
The blood pressure for an 8- year-old should be less than 120/80. The history of recent strep throat, blood pressure, periorbital edema and changes in urine output are the most significant findings because they suggest the child has poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.  The child is at risk for heart failure, seizures, and encephalopathy due to hypertension and fluid overload as evidenced by bilateral periorbital edema, decreased urine output, hematuria, and high blood pressure of 128/80. 
 

The nurse suspects poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and considers the child’s risks.

Rationale
 
The child is at risk for fluid overload leading to hypertension and cardio- pulmonary  congestion leading to heart failure. Untreated the decreased urine output, hematuria, and high blood pressure  can lead to renal failure. Gastrointestinal, endocrine, and hepatic complications are not known ramifications of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.

0/1. This item is worth 8 points. Give yourself 1 point for every row you got right.
Screen  5 of 6
Rationale
 When teaching is complex, teaching should be broken down into short segments. Upon admission the things that are most important for the nurse to address before leaving the client alone are the bedrest and fluid restriction orders, signs and symptoms to call the nurse for (in this case seizures or changes in LOC) and diagnostic test that are ordered so the client will not be surprised if another team member comes into the room. Medication teaching should be done when the medicine is given. Diet teaching will need to be done before lunch. Since the client is on bedrest discussions of strenuous activities can occur later. Discussions of monitoring urine output can occur when the child needs to void. 

The nurse evaluates the family’s understanding of the treatment plan. 
For each client statement, click to specify whether the statement indicates an understanding, or no understanding of teaching provided.

Screen  6 of 6
Rationale
 The child is experiencing poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. The child is at risk for seizures and encephalopathy.  The parent must understand the importance of close monitoring for changes in LOC or seizure activity and when to seek additional medical attention.

Screen 3 of 6
Rationale
 The client is presenting with several safety concerns, and it is crucial to keep them safe. While it is important to continue suicide risk assessments, it is clear the client is presenting with immediate safety needs related to suicidal comments and behaviors and suicide precautions must be implemented.  Hourly suicided assessments are not sufficient.

Rationale
The nurse should identify signs and symptoms of post-operative complications that need to be addressed.  Signs of atelectasis include increased heart rate, increased respirations, breathing difficulties and low oxygen levels.  Breath sounds will be diminished due to collapsed alveoli.  Blood pressure is not affected unless it becomes elevated due to the stress of breathing difficulties.  Pain medication is important but first the breathing issues must be addressed.

Screen 2 of 6
Rationale
 The nurse should differentiate signs and symptoms of atelectasis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and fluid overload in clients with respiratory distress following surgery. All respiratory issues include shortness of breath and increased respirations, and decreased pulse oximeter readings. Diminished breath sounds and repressed coughing are most associated with post-op atelectasis. Coughing, rhonchi, wheezing, or crackles would be expected with the other three conditions.  Low-grade fever and normal and stable blood pressures would be expected with atelectasis and pneumonia. Fever could also be higher with pneumonia.  Unstable blood pressures would be expected for pulmonary embolism or fluid overload. Hypotension is typically seen with pulmonary embolism. Hypertension is associated with fluid overload.

Screen 4 of 6
Rationale
The XRAY confirms atelectasis. Proper nursing interventions include sitting the client up to aid with breathing.  Supine position can make breathing more difficult.  Applying oxygen via nasal cannula can also make breathing easier.  Using the incentive spirometer can also make breathing easier. Controlling pain improves compliance with incentive spirometry.  Extra fluid does not help a client with breathing and can put the client at risk for fluid overload.  A CBC is not necessary for monitoring atelectasis as it would be for detecting and infection.

Screen  5 of 6
Rationale
    The nurse should teach the client with atelectasis interventions that can improve their oxygenation.   The nurse can instruct the client to be out of bed and ambulate, to take deep breaths in order to increase lung capacity and open up the alveoli.  The incentive spirometer can also help improve lung function.  The client should increase the fluids to about 3,000 ml /day to thin mucous secretions and use pain medication so they can take deep breaths.

Rationale
  The nurse should recognize that the client has improved if the oxygen saturation is within normal limits and the client is coughing after using the incentive spirometer. Breath sounds were diminished on left and make take several cycles of deep breathing and coughing to improve. The increasing fever would indicate that the client’s condition had decreased and an infection may now be present.

 The child is showing signs of moderate dehydration including decreased tears, decreased urine output, pale/dry oral mucosa and irritability. He is not demonstrating hypotension or signs of shock at this time. It is the standard of care to attempt oral rehydration in an outpatient setting for moderate dehydration, but the child’s perfusion and circulation should be monitored to ensure he does not decompensate. His intake should also be closely monitored to ensure he is retaining some of the rehydration offered.

Screen 4 of 6
Rationale
The nurse should prioritize interventions that would relieve pressure within the compartment, monitor for improving or declining condition, and treat potential life or limb threatening conditions. This would include frequent neurovascular assessments and preparing to remove the cast as soon as possible by getting the cast removal saw to the bedside. The provider is likely to insert a compartment pressure measurement manometer to assess compartmental pressures. Client should be kept NPO in the event surgery is required. Pain medication such as morphine is indicated, and due to hypotension an IV fluid bolus is indicated. Ibuprofen is not effective for the pain rate of 10/10, and 400 mg would not be a therapeutic dose. Aspirin is contraindicated due to the anticoagulation component if the client needs surgery. The surgical team should be consulted. Client would not be instructed on crutch walking at this time until the compartment syndrome is resolved. Respiratory and Case Management for long-term care are not indicated at this time.

    To accomplish all the tasks needed to care for this client the nurse may delegate some tasks to  the UAP. The UAP is unable to perform assessments or monitor neurovascular status. t is the nurses’ responsibility to ensure client is ready for surgery. The pre-operative checklist may be used to ensure all pre-operative criteria is met. Measuring and documenting VS, Intake and Output, height and weight may all be done by the UAP. The UAP may also help the client to maintain the extremity in the proper position as instructed by the Nurse.

Rationale
When magnesium toxicity is suspected the infusion should be stopped, a rapid response activated, and calcium gluconate administered.  The patient should receive oxygen because of respiratory depression. The fetus should be assessed any time there is a complication with the mother. Serum magnesium would confirm toxicity. Checking for medication error is necessary after medication-related complications. Supine position could make shortness of breath worse. Anti-seizure medication would be necessary for eclampsia, which this client does not have.  Elevation of extremities is unrelated to magnesium toxicity.

Rationale
 Side effects are predictable unintended responses to medications. For stimulants used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorders side effects include decreased appetite, rapid weight loss and insomnia. Side effects can often be managed without discontinuing treatment. Adverse reactions are less predictable, more severe, and more likely to require discontinuing treatment. The client is having a therapeutic effect (improved behavior/school performance) on the target dose thus it is unlikely the effects are due to non- compliance. There is no evidence of  drug dependence.

About The NextGen NCLEX
Starting April 1, 2023,  graduates will take an updated version of the National Council Licensure Exam referred to as Next Generation NCLEX.
Next Generation NCLEX (NGN) will continue to test a candidate’s ability to provide safe client care while incorporating new methods to better test clinical judgment.   
The testing methods will include using new item response types in clinical judgment case studies and stand-alone questions to test the NCSBN Clinical Judgment Measurement Model(NCJMM) (https://www.ncsbn.org/exams/next-generation-nclex/NGN+Resources/clinical-judgment-measurement-model.page)

Extended multiple response items with increased answer options. 
Drag-and-drop items that involve moving options to placeholders.
Drop-down items where candidates select the missing words from sentences, paragraphs, or tables.
Highlight items that require candidates to identify parts of the medical record to answer questions. 
Matrix/grid items that involve completing tables of information.

The Five New Item Response Types
Unfolding case studies use approved NGN item types to answer questions about evolving real-world nursing scenarios.
Case studies present 6 linked questions to test the 6 steps of the NCJMM in order:
Recognize cues
Analyze cues
Prioritize hypotheses 
Generate solutions
Take action
Evaluate outcomes
Candidates should expect to complete a minimum of 3 and maximum of 5 case studies in the first 85 questions. (NGN News - Winter 2022 | NCSBN)

Case Studies
Stand-alone (single) items test either client needs or clinical judgment.
Client needs items, like in previous versions of NCLEX, flow from the detailed test plan. 
Clinical judgment items present information in a clinical scenario specifically targeting one or more NCJMM clinical judgment step.
There are 2 unique types of clinical judgment stand-alone items: 
Bowtie 
Trend  
Clinical judgment stand-alone items make up approximately 10% of stand-alone items.

Stand-alone Item Types
Bowties are a drag-and-drop response item variation.  
After reading a clinical scenario, candidates move response options (tokens) to placeholders (targets).
On NCLEX the placeholders are arranged in the shape of a bowtie.
Candidates must select:
1 condition the client is most likely experiencing from 4 options.
2 actions to take to address the condition from 5 options.
2 parameters to monitor the client’s progress from 5 options. 

Stand-alone Item: Bowtie
Trend items require the candidate to make clinical judgments based on client data presented at different time points.
 Trend items may address one or more steps of the NCJMM, but do not follow the six-item sequence or unfold like case studies do.
 Trend items can feature any item response type except the drag-and-drop bowtie variation.


Stand-alone Item: Trends
This test bank is designed to give students practice answering case studies and stand-alone items in an electronic format.
While questions throughout the test bank use all 5 new item response types, some specific variations, such as drop-downs in a table, are not included.
Students use information from a medical record to answer questions, but the medical record will display differently on the actual NCLEX. 
To see how items will exactly appear on NCLEX see tutorials, sample packs, and exam preview at https://www.nclex.com/prepare.page

About The Word Documents
Faculty read the word documents and decide what case studies or stand-alone items to assign. 
The word documents are for faculty use and are the only place where the correct answers appear!
The authors give permission for other faculty to use or modify the documents to design activities for their classrooms or to train other faculty. 
Commercial use of the case studies is not permitted without written consent.

Questions are loaded into Qualtrics
Faculty assign a clinical judgment case study, trend, or bowtie.
Instruct students to access the clinical judgment item one of 3 ways:
A URL (Link) you provide found on the word document
A QR code you provide found on the word document
Searching  the NextGen NCLEX Test Bank for the item by name at: https://www.nursing.umaryland.edu/mnwc/mnwc-initiatives/nextgen-nclex/nextgen-nclex-test-bank/
For best results  students should access the clinical judgment items with a computer or tablet rather than a phone or smart watch. 

Try The Question Yourself 
It is recommended that faculty  access the question in Qualtrics and practice taking it before assigning it to students.
If you use the correct answer for each item and save your response summary, it can later serve as an answer key

NextGen NCLEX Test Bank Limitation #1: Items are not in a Secure Data Base
The items were created to use for teaching clinical judgment and formative assessment not summative testing.
The word documents with the complete case studies with answers are in a database that is not password protected.
Faculty have permission to modify the cases and/or load them into their own testing platform for testing if desired. 

NextGen NCLEX Test Bank Limitation# 2 Only Project Manager Can Alter Qualtrics 
Peer reviewed NGN items were loaded into Qualtrics for use state-wide through the Maryland Nursing Workforce Center.
If you have concerns about a specific item, please discuss it with the champion at your school. They can make recommendations to the project managers. 
Faculty have permission to take the word document and modify cases for noncommercial use in their class in anyway they desire.
Faculty have permission to upload items into their own testing platform or Qualtrics site to use for their courses.
NextGen NCLEX Test Bank Limitation# 3Qualtrics Does Not Give Correct Answers, Rationales, or Scores
Qualtrics will not give students the correct answers or scores.
Qualtrics has no capability to auto score highlight or drag- and- drop questions.
Faculty must give students the answers to the questions either through discussion or through a posted a document. 
Answer document can be a response summaries from faculty.

Providing Answers
Teaching Approach
Have students answer questions in class.
download  answers for class or small group discussion.
Guide discussion with or without PowerPoints.
Formative Assessment Approach
Have students answer questions before class or after a lecture
Upload the response summaries in an LMS system.
Answer questions yourself with correct answers. Download your response summary and post in LMS system as answer key. 
Review group responses and provide feedback.    

Before using the Test Bank
Be sure students understand the 6 steps of the NCSBN Clinical Judgment Measurement Model.
Teach students about the different item types and how to answer them .

Give a brief lecture that ends with a QR code to related case study.
Have students work in small groups to answer the questions.
Instruct students to download their response summaries to their computer for discussion.
Follow with classroom discussion of the answers, give answers given verbally on a PowerPoint.
Reinforce learning by having students write an SBAR report of the case.  



Ideas for Use # 1Answer Questions in Class
Have students do a case study before class and upload items into LMS as a ticket to class.
Take the quiz yourself and input correct answers. Download the quiz as an answer key then upload it  into LMS for students to review after they submit their responses 
Review responses and give a just –in- time lecture to correct misconceptions.
Have students complete the related stand-alone item after lecture to reinforce learning.

Ideas for Use # 2 Use Questions as Pre-class Assignment
Lead a classroom discussion of the case using prompts for each clinical judgment steps 
See examples at Hensel, D., & Billings, D. M. (2020). Strategies to teach the National Council of State Boards of nursing clinical judgment model. Nurse Educator, 45(3), 128-132).
Have students do questions following week to see if learning was retained.  

Idea for use # 3: Do the Case in Class Using Prompts
Give EMR from question 1 and have students write a reverse case study or reverse Bowtie.
Simple variation of reverse Bowtie: Student provide correct responses for the condition most likely experiencing, two actions to take, and two parameters to monitor. 
In complex variation students complete the entire Bowtie grid by listing the addition conditions, and one action to take and parameter to monitor for each. Selection of parameters and actions for the addition conditions should not be ones indicated for the correct condition. 
See Hensel (2022),  Reverse Bowties as a clinical judgment teaching strategy, 47 (5), p 282. doi: 10.1097/NNE.0000000000001225).
Idea  for Use# 4: Create Activities from the Word Document Medical Record
Create a worksheet with a single matrix grid question as a classroom assessment technique for  formative assessment.
Practice categorizing information in matrix tables helps make information retrieval easier.  
Give feedback on responses.

Idea for Use  # 5:  Create Paper Pencil Versions of Single Questions from the Word Document 
Mini reviews are a combination of case studies and stand-alone items formatted with links to questions, answers and rationales in a PowerPoint presentation.
Mini reviews can be done as a group or as individual study

Screen 1 of 6
6 statements are selectable
Rationale
The priority concern for this client is safety. The RN should immediately follow up with the brother’s statement about guns being in the house and the client having an active plan to use them to cause harm. The RN should also be concerned about access to the sharps box with her recent suicide attempt and the client’s statement of wanting to end her life.

Give yourself 1 point if you answered correctly.
Screen 3 of 6
Rationale
 The client is presenting with several safety concerns, and it is crucial to keep them safe. While it is important to continue suicide risk assessments, it is clear the client is presenting with immediate safety needs related to suicidal comments and behaviors and suicide precautions must be implemented.  Hourly suicided assessments are not sufficient. 

0/1. This item is worth 7 points. Give yourself 1 point for every row you got right.
Screen 4 of 6
Rationale
 The room should be prepared with limited linen, removal of all sharp objects, and removal of unnecessary cables, cords, and equipment when a client is on suicide precautions. There is not necessarily a restriction on staff or visitors. Visitors should be screened, and a Chaplin can be consulted per the client request. It is important to conduct frequent safety assessments, but vital signs every 5 minutes and restraints are not necessary currently.

Dehydration= 5 points
Alzheimer’s disease = 1  point
Delirium= 4 points
Rationale
 Rising levels of BUN/creatinine and sodium/potassium are linked to both dehydration and consequently, a metabolic trigger for delirium. Decreased urine output is more directly linked to dehydration.  Orthostatic hypotension can be a symptom of dehydration/fluid volume deficit. Chronic confusion is a sign of Alzheimer’s disease/dementia but fluctuating LOC and perceptual disturbances/hallucinations are indicative of delirium.  Persons with dementia are generally in steady state of alertness until very late in the illness, or, if experiencing delirium superimposed on dementia.

0/1. This  question is worth 4 points.
Give yourself 1 point for each correct response.
Screen 1 of 6
Rationale
Tongue thrusting is an extrapyramidal adverse effect caused by risperidone (Burcham & Rosenthal, 2022).  This is an adverse effect of the second-generation antipsychotic risperidone.   Other metabolic adverse effects include weight gain, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia (Burcham & Rosenthal, 2022).  Other concerning issues include the patient’s inability to sleep.  Sleep disturbance is a core symptom of bipolar disorder (Roloff et al , 2022). A fine hand tremor is concerning since the client is on lithium, but it is a common side effect and not a top priority.

0/1. This  question is worth 1 point.
Give yourself 1 point if you got this right.
Screen 2 of 6
Rationale
 Some factors require immediate attention – such as tongue thrusting – since it is an adverse effect of risperidone.  This is an extra pyramidal symptom (EPS).  If this symptom is not reported early and managed, it can be irreversible (Burcham & Rosenthal, 2022).  Other factors, like metabolic adverse effects of risperidone (HgbA1C, weight gain) may occur and should be evaluated, but do not require immediate attention (Burcham & Rosenthal, 2022).  Fatigue or difficulty sleeping should be monitored since this could be an indication of depression.  

Rationale. This  question is worth 1 point.
Give yourself 1 point only if you  BOTH parts  correct.
Screen 3 of 6
Rationale
 Tongue thrusting is an extrapyramidal symptom, which can be caused by antipsychotic medications, that can be irreversible if not identified early in therapy. (Burchum & Rosenthal, 2022).  Other EPS symptoms include akathisia, acute dystonia and pseudo-Parkinsonism.  

0/1. This item is worth 2 points. Give yourself 1 point for every correct option selected.
Screen 4 of 6
Rationale
 Due to the serious adverse effects of risperidone, the nurse should expect that the drug be discontinued.  This client requires maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder and monotherapy with lithium, a mood stabilizer, is usually sufficient. If the patient experiences a manic episode, a different antipsychotic, besides risperidone, might be prescribed ( Micromedex, 2022). The nurse should monitor for other adverse effects (Burchum & Rosenthal, 2022).

Screen  5 of 6
Rationale
 The client has to be monitored for the frequency of tardive dyskinesia (uncontrolled orofacial movements) to see if the tardive dyskinesia is subsiding.  The nurse should also teach the client and family to monitor for bipolar symptoms (e.g., depressive symptoms and or suicidality or symptoms of mania).  Since the client will be maintained on lithium, which has a very narrow therapeutic index,  the client and family must monitor for adverse effects indicative of toxicity.  Hydration status is key to maintaining a stable lithium concentration and changes in sodium or hydration status can lead to therapeutic excess or failure (Burcham & Rosenthal, 2022).

Screen  6 of 6
Rationale
 In reviewing the client’s status, the patient appears to be improving in some manner (no more tardive dyskinesia) but his appearance and stopping school may indicate that his mental status may have declined.  The nurse should evaluate the client to determine if the findings indicate depression.

Rationale
 The client is most likely experiencing dehydration. There is no evidence of severe anemia, hypoglycemia or shock at this time. The client needs potassium supplementation and IV fluids to correct the fluid and electrolyte imbalance. The client does not need a blood transfusion at this time, oxygen levels are stable, and no oxygen is needed. Urine output will need to be monitored to assess improved fluid balance. Blood glucose does not need to be checked as the client has no signs of hypoglycemia. Pulse oximetry is not needed as this is stable. The client needs routine electrolyte monitoring but there is no need to monitor hemoglobin and hematocrit as this is stable.

Rationale
The client is presenting with several serious symptoms. The symptoms which are most significant are the sudden fever, muscle rigidity, delirium, and irregular tachycardic heart rate. The diaphoresis is significant but can be explained by a high fever. The respiratory rate is mildly  elevated but not life threatening. The pulse oximeter is normal.

Rationale
 Though rare, neuroleptic malignant syndrome can be fatal. The client vitals and labs indicate that the client is declining rapidly. Tardive dyskinesia is not life-threatening and is characterized by involuntary facial movements. Extra pyramidal symptoms can be fatal and characterized by involuntary movements not hyperthermia. Agranulocytosis is a low white blood cell count. It does not cause muscle rigidity.

: The olanzapine must be stopped immediately as this is what caused the neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The hyperthermia must immediately be addressed by the addition of cooling measures. Starting the IV is critical to prevent dehydration from the fever and diaphoresis and to establish access for giving medications. A creatine kinase value will help guide treatment, but obtaining one is not as critical as implementing supportive care. Treating the muscle rigidity is lower priority that treating the high fever and  cannot be done until the IV is started. The urine must be monitored and documented but placing the foley is not the highest priority.

About The NextGen NCLEX
Starting April 1, 2023,  graduates will take an updated version of the National Council Licensure Exam referred to as Next Generation NCLEX.
Next Generation NCLEX (NGN) will continue to test a candidate’s ability to provide safe client care while incorporating new methods to better test clinical judgment.   
The testing methods will include using new item response types in clinical judgment case studies and stand-alone questions to test the NCSBN Clinical Judgment Measurement Model(NCJMM) (https://www.ncsbn.org/exams/next-generation-nclex/NGN+Resources/clinical-judgment-measurement-model.page)

Extended multiple response items with increased answer options. 
Drag-and-drop items that involve moving options to placeholders.
Drop-down items where candidates select the missing words from sentences, paragraphs, or tables.
Highlight items that require candidates to identify parts of the medical record to answer questions. 
Matrix/grid items that involve completing tables of information.

The Five New Item Response Types
Unfolding case studies use approved NGN item types to answer questions about evolving real-world nursing scenarios.
Case studies present 6 linked questions to test the 6 steps of the NCJMM in order:
Recognize cues
Analyze cues
Prioritize hypotheses 
Generate solutions
Take action
Evaluate outcomes
Candidates should expect to complete 3 to 5 case studies in a minimum length 85 question NCLEX exam. 
Case Studies
Stand-alone (single) items test either client needs or clinical judgment
Client needs items test knowledge of the 8 client needs using traditional or new item types.  
Clinical judgment items present information in a clinical scenario specifically targeting one or more NCJMM clinical judgment step.
There are 2 unique types of clinical judgment stand-alone items: 
Bowtie 
Trend  
Clinical judgment stand-alone items make up approximately 10% of stand-alone items.

Stand-alone Item Types
A bowtie is a drag-and-drop response item variation.  
After reading a clinical scenario, candidates move response options (tokens) to placeholders (targets).
On NCLEX the placeholders are arranged in the shape of a bowtie.
Candidates must select:
1 condition the client is most likely experiencing from 4 options.
2 actions to take to address the condition from 5 options.
2 parameters to monitor the client’s progress from 5 options. 

Stand-alone Item: Bowtie
Trend items require the candidate to make clinical judgments based on client data presented at different time points.
 Trend items may address one or more clinical judgment steps but do not follow the six-item sequence like case studies do.
 Trend items can feature any item response type except bowtie.


Stand-alone Item: Trends
Your instructor will provide a QR code or link to answer a series of case studies, bowtie items and trends across a lifespan 
While questions throughout the test bank use all 5 new item response, not all specific variations that might be used on NCLEX are not included such as drop-down items formatted as a table.
Information needed to answer questions will be displayed in a medical record, but the medical record will display differently on the actual NCLEX.

Rationale
Magnesium toxicity is characterized by respiratory depression, decreased urinary output, and loss of deep tendon reflexes. Cutaneous flushing and sweating are expected side effects of magnesium administration and are not concerning. Blood pressure at 0900 is expected since the client has severe preeclampsia. Magnesium infusion can cause hypotension.

Screen 4 of 6
Rationale
When magnesium toxicity is suspected the infusion should be stopped, a rapid response activated, and calcium gluconate administered.  The patient should receive oxygen because of respiratory depression. The fetus should be assessed any time there is a complication with the mother. Serum magnesium would confirm toxicity. Checking for medication error is necessary after medication-related complications. Supine position could make shortness of breath worse. Anti-seizure medication would be necessary for eclampsia, which this client does not have.  Elevation of extremities is unrelated to magnesium toxicity.

Screen 1 of 6
Rationale
Bilirubin is produced by the breakdown of hemoglobin.  A build-up of bilirubin in the body causes a yellow skin color called jaundice.  Jaundice and yellow sclera are signs of hyperbilirubinemia. This is urgent as high bilirubin can cause brain damage and death.  This combined with the dry mucous membranes, and slightly depressed fontanelle may indicate the newborn is developing hypovolemia. Both hypovolemia and hyperbilirubinemia can cause lethargy. Epstein pearls are very small keratin cysts that appear in the mouths of more than 50% of newborns. Epstein pearls are benign and disappear after a few weeks. A clamped umbilicus is normal. Passing 1 stool and voiding once on day  1 are typical findings/ The vital signs are within normal limits for a newborn.
0/1. This  question is worth 6 points
Give yourself 1 point for each row you get correct. 
Screen 2 of 6
Rationale
Hyperbilirubinemia can come from increased bilirubin production and or delayed excretion. The majority of bilirubin is produced from the breakdown of hemoglobin into unconjugated bilirubin. Unconjugated bilirubin binds to albumin in the blood for transport to the liver, where it is taken up by hepatocytes and conjugated to make it water-soluble so it can be excreted in stool and urine. Breastfeeding problems that lead to inadequate intake, and poor hydration, evidenced by the dry mucous membranes and depressed fontanelles, can result in decreased excretion of bilirubin. Rh incompatibility occurs when a mother who is type Rh - gives birth to an infant who is Rh+ and develops anti-Rh antibodies in her serum. The antibodies attack the infant’s blood cells, causing the cells to lyse and producing a hemolytic anemia. The development of antibodies typically happens during the birthing process, so antibodies are present in subsequent pregnancies. Passing 1 stool in the first day of life is an expected finding and would not be considered a risk factor. The length of rupture of membranes was typical and would not be considered a risk factor. 

Rationale. This  question is worth 1 point.
Give yourself 1 point only if you answered BOTH parts correctly.
Screen 3 of 6
Rationale
Visible jaundice on the first day of life and the high bilirubin level rising more than 5mg/dL a day indicate pathological jaundice. The direct antiglobulin test shows that there are maternal Rh antibodies adhering to the infant’s Rh+ red blood cells lysing the cells. Untreated, this will lead to a hemolytic anemia and possible kernicterus. Poor intake an excretion can complicate the problem but are not the underlying cause of the pathological jaundice. 

+/-. This item is worth 5 points. Score each category separately, then add scores together. Score 1 point for each correct response AND subtract 1 point for each incorrect answer. The worst you can score is 0 per category.
Phototherapy= 3 points
Nursing= 2  points

Screen 4 of 6
Rationale
Phototherapy lights can cause retinal damage, hyperthermia, and bronzed baby syndrome. The nurse must plan interventions to decrease the risk of these adverse effects of therapy. Dehydration is another potential complication of phototherapy. Phototherapy increases insensible water losses. To maximize time under the lights, it is recommended that the baby not be removed from under the phototherapy lights for more than 20 minutes every 3-4 hours. This can interfere with feeding. A lactation consultant can help the breastfeeding parent maximize the efficiency of the time breastfeeding. The nurse should monitor the neonate’s hydration status by weighing the diapers. Although this neonate is struggling to breastfeed, supplementing feedings with formula are not the first choice as they may interfere with establishing breastfeeding. 
 

The
0/1. This item is worth 6 points. Give yourself 1 point for every row you got correct. 
Screen  5 of 6
Rationale
 Immediately – Based on the total serum bilirubin level phototherapy should be initiated. 
Before end of shift –A lactation consultation is needed to improve breast feeding to help prevent dehydration and increase stooling to help excrete bilirubin. Parents will need to know how to interact with their infant while they are receiving phototherapy. Parents will need to understand the disease process as a rationale for the therapy needed and adherence to recommendations for time spent under phototherapy. 
By discharge – Once the baby is discharged, follow-up total serum bilirubin levels may be needed to assess for rebound hyperbilirubinemia. 

The
0/1. This item is worth 4 points. Give yourself 1 point for row you got correct. 
Screen  6 of 6
Rationale
 Breastfeeding has improved because the baby is able to latch now and has voided and stooled. The increased bilirubin levels after phototherapy shows a decline. The development of backward arching may indicate opisthotonos which develops as increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin cross the blood brain barrier and the bilirubin adheres to the neural cells in the brain. Opisthotonos is a sign of severe neurological damage. The sclera was yellow prior to beginning phototherapy and remains unchanged.

Drag the 4 findings are most significant to the box on the right
Client Findings	
Blood pressure*	
Periorbital edema*	
Poor appetite	
Headache	
Fatigue	
Urine output*	
Increased intake of fluids	
History of strep throat*

0/1. This  question is worth 4 points.
Give yourself 1 point for each correct response. 
Screen 1 of 6
Rationale
The blood pressure for an 8- year-old should be less than 120/80. The history of recent strep throat, blood pressure, periorbital edema and changes in urine output are the most significant findings because they suggest the child has poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.  The child is at risk for heart failure, seizures, and encephalopathy due to hypertension and fluid overload as evidenced by bilateral periorbital edema, decreased urine output, hematuria, and high blood pressure of 128/80.  

The nurse suspects poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and considers the child’s risks.
Which of the following complications is the client at risk for experiencing?  Select all that apply
Bowel obstruction
Heart failure*
Diabetes
Liver failure
Fluid overload* 
Acute renal failure*
Adrenal insufficiency
Hypertension*

+/-. This  question is worth 4 points.
Give yourself 1 point for each correct response
AND subtract 1 point for each incorrect response you select. The least you can score is 0.  
Screen 2 of 6
Rationale
 The child is at risk for fluid overload leading to hypertension and cardio- pulmonary  congestion leading to heart failure. Untreated the decreased urine output, hematuria, and high blood pressure  can lead to renal failure. Gastrointestinal, endocrine, and hepatic complications are not known ramifications of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. 

Labs return and the child receives the diagnosis of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.
Complete the sentence from the list of drop-down options.

0/1. This  question is worth 1 point.
Give yourself 1 point if you answered correctly.
Screen 3 of 6
Rationale
 The top priority is to manage the fluid overload. Managing the overload will help the blood pressure. The nurse will anticipate orders to treat the infection, however the problem is being caused by an immune response not an infection.

Select the orders from each of the categories the nurse should anticipate including in the plan of care. Each category may have more than one order. 

+/-. This item is worth 5 points- Score each category separately first and then add scores together.. Score 1 point for each correct answer AND subtract 1point for each incorrect answer. The worst you can score is 0 per category.
Medications = 2 points
Nursing= 3 points
Screen 4 of 6
Rationale
 The child is experiencing poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.  Treatment will include antibiotics for positive Group A streptococcal infection and diuretic therapy for fluid overload and hypertension. Antihypertensives will be added as needed. Other treatment will include strict I&O, sodium and fluid restrictions, and neuro checks every 6 hours due to risk of development of seizures and encephalopathy.

The The nurse plans the family teaching about the treatment plan.
For each teaching point, click to specify if the nurse should address the teaching immediately upon admission, within the next hour, or before the end of the shift.

0/1. This item is worth 8 points. Give yourself 1 point for every row you got right.
Screen  5 of 6
Rationale
 When teaching is complex, teaching should be broken down into short segments. Upon admission the things that are most important for the nurse to address before leaving the client alone are the bedrest and fluid restriction orders, signs and symptoms to call the nurse for (in this case seizures or changes in LOC) and diagnostic test that are ordered so the client will not be surprised if another team member comes into the room. Medication teaching should be done when the medicine is given. Diet teaching will need to be done before lunch. Since the client is on bedrest discussions of strenuous activities can occur later. Discussions of monitoring urine output can occur when the child needs to void. 

The nurse evaluates the family’s understanding of the treatment plan. 
For each client statement, click to specify whether the statement indicates an understanding, or no understanding of teaching provided. 
0/1. This item is worth 4 points. Give yourself 1 point for every row you got right.
Screen  6 of 6
Rationale
 The child is experiencing poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. The child is at risk for seizures and encephalopathy.  The parent must understand the importance of close monitoring for changes in level of consciousness or seizure activity and when to seek additional medical attention.

Rationale
 The child is showing signs of moderate dehydration including decreased tears, decreased urine output, pale/dry oral mucosa and irritability. He is not demonstrating hypotension or signs of shock at this time. It is the standard of care to attempt oral rehydration in an outpatient setting for moderate dehydration, but the child’s perfusion and circulation should be monitored to ensure he does not decompensate. His intake should also be closely monitored to ensure he is retaining some of the rehydration offered.

Screen 4 of 6
Rationale
 Child is not hyperventilating, so loss of CO2 is not a concern requiring breathing into a bag. Albuterol can be used to relieve breathing symptoms. Heimlich maneuver is not indicated as child does not have food lodged in throat. Inducing vomiting is not indicated for situation. Injectable epinephrine should be given, and parents should be notified.

0/1. This item is worth 1 point. Give yourself 1 point if you got it right.
Screen  5 of 6
Rationale
 Injectable epinephrine is indicated as first priority due to the student’s immediate condition; child is in anaphylaxis and a PO medication is not indicated. Albuterol may be used but would not be the first priority and activating EMS would happen after the epinephrine is given. 

0/1. This item is worth 6 points. Give yourself 1 point for every row you got right.
Screen  6 of 6
Rationale
 Reassessment indicates improvement in areas of respiratory status, facial swelling, and itching which is expected with the use of epinephrine. No changes with blood pressure and temperature. Heart rate has increased, and child is reporting symptoms of lightheadedness which both could be a result of the epinephrine.

Screen 1 of 6
Rationale
It is important to note that the child has what appears to be a typical illness, and not other more serious symptoms. The seizure symptoms including unresponsiveness, rigidity and shaking of limbs are typical for tonic- clonic febrile seizure. Seizure length is important to note, seizures longer than 15 minutes are typically recommended for ER transfer.

0/1. This  question is worth 4 points.
Give yourself 1 point for every correct option you selected.
Screen 2 of 6
Rationale
The nurse needs to identify if the child is in immediate physical or physiologic danger. In a triage setting this is often completed by standard questions. The child’s birth history, intake and output and developmental status are not priorities. The nurse will need to know if the child has any underlying medical conditions or has received any medications recently. 

0/1. This  question is worth 1 point.
Give yourself 1 point if you answered correctly.
Screen 3 of 6
Rationale
 The child’s neurologic status remains impaired. Current respiratory status appears stable, and the infection and intake and output are not the highest priority. 





0/1. This item is worth 8 points. Give yourself 1 point for every row you got correct.
Screen 4 of 6
Rationale
 It is expected for a child to remain lethargic post seizure. While very lethargic, no oral medications or fluids should be attempted. Fever is best managed with an antipyretic, and rectal route if available is best for the neurologically altered child. A cool bath is never indicated for fever management. At this point, MRI, antiepileptic and antibiotic are not indicated. The nurse should instruct the parent to maintain safe positioning while the child is altered, and schedule to see the physician as soon as possible.

+/-. This item is worth 4 points.  Score 1 point for each correct answer you selected AND  subtract 1point for each incorrect answer you picked. The worst you can score is 0. 

Screen  5 of 6
Rationale
 The nurse should convey importance of safety/continued monitoring of the child’s condition, appropriate fever management and follow up as needed. Febrile seizures are not contagious although the underlying illness causing the fever could be contagious. Febrile seizures typically resolve in early childhood and do not require ongoing medical management. 120 mg of acetaminophen is subtherapeutic for the child’s weight. 

0/1. This item is worth 6 points. Give yourself 1 point for every row you got right.
Screen  6 of 6
Rationale
 The child with a febrile seizure may need closer monitoring while ill or potentially febrile as one febrile seizure can be predictive of future febrile seizures. Children typically experience febrile seizures as infants or young children (1-4 years old) and outgrow febrile seizures with no remaining deficits or neurologic issues and do not need chronic antiepileptics. Rectal acetaminophen is not necessary for the child who is able to take oral medications but may be needed for the child who is neurologically impaired or lethargic.

Rationale
 Side effects are predictable unintended responses to medications. For stimulants used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorders side effects include decreased appetite, rapid weight loss and insomnia. Side effects can often be managed without discontinuing treatment. Adverse reactions are less predictable, more severe, and more likely to require discontinuing treatment. The client is having a therapeutic effect (improved behavior/school performance) on the target dose thus it is unlikely the effects are due to non- compliance. There is no evidence of  drug dependence.

About The NextGen NCLEX
Starting April 1, 2023,  graduates will take an updated version of the National Council Licensure Exam referred to as Next Generation NCLEX.
Next Generation NCLEX (NGN) will continue to test a candidate’s ability to provide safe client care while incorporating new methods to better test clinical judgment.   
The testing methods will include using new item response types in clinical judgment case studies and stand-alone questions to test the NCSBN Clinical Judgment Measurement Model(NCJMM) (https://www.ncsbn.org/exams/next-generation-nclex/NGN+Resources/clinical-judgment-measurement-model.page)
Ideally meant to be instructor lead, but could be used independently by students 
This could be used by December graduates who fail NCLEX on 1st try and need to retake on NGN. 


Extended multiple response items with increased answer options. 
Drag-and-drop items that involve moving options to placeholders.
Drop-down items where candidates select the missing words from sentences, paragraphs, or tables.
Highlight items that require candidates to identify parts of the medical record to answer questions. 
Matrix/grid items that involve completing tables of information.

The Five New Item Response Types
Unfolding case studies use approved NGN item types to answer questions about evolving real-world nursing scenarios.
Case studies present 6 linked questions to test the 6 steps of the NCJMM in order:
Recognize cues
Analyze cues
Prioritize hypotheses 
Generate solutions
Take action
Evaluate outcomes
Candidates should expect to complete 3 to 5 case studies in a minimum length 85 question NCLEX exam. 
Case Studies
Stand-alone (single) items test either client needs or clinical judgment
Client needs items test knowledge of the 8 client needs using traditional or new item types.  
Clinical judgment items present information in a clinical scenario specifically targeting one or more NCJMM clinical judgment step.
There are 2 unique types of clinical judgment stand-alone items: 
Bow-tie 
Trend  
Clinical judgment stand-alone items make up approximately 10% of stand-alone items.

Stand-alone Item Types
A bowtie is a drag-and-drop response item variation.  
After reading a clinical scenario, candidates move response options (tokens) to placeholders (targets).
On NCLEX the placeholders are arranged in the shape of a bowtie.
Candidates must select:
1 condition the client is most likely experiencing from 4 options.
2 actions to take to address the condition from 5 options.
2 parameters to monitor the client’s progress from 5 options. 

Stand-alone Item: Bowtie
Bowties in Qualtrics
Bowties in Qualtrics are 3 drop and drag question- but they don’t make a “bowtie” shape. 
Trend items require the candidate to make clinical judgments based on client data presented at different time points.
 Trend items may address one or more clinical judgment steps but do not follow the six-item sequence like case studies do.
 Trend items can feature any item response type except bowtie.


Stand-alone Item: Trends
Your instructor will provide a QR code or link to answer a series of case studies, bowtie items and trends across a lifespan 
While questions throughout the test bank use all 5 new item response, not all specific variations that might be used on NCLEX are not included such as drop-down items formatted as a table.
Information needed to answer questions will be displayed in a medical record, but the medical record will display differently on the actual NCLEX. 
To see how items will exactly appear on NCLEX see tutorials at https://nclex.com/next-generation-nclex.page

Case Study Question 1 of 6 
A 26-year-old woman presents in the emergency department with a sudden onset of lightheadedness and generalized weakness of the left lower and upper extremities.  

 Click to highlight the findings that require immediate follow-up. 



Key


Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: A disruption of the blood supply to brain areas leads to a sudden loss of motor function. Like a myocardial infarction or heart attack, a disruption of blood flow to the brain is a medical emergency that requires immediate and intentional interventions. Lightheadedness, weakness of the left lower and upper extremity, sudden headache, elevated heart rate, elevated blood pressure, denotes poor cerebral perfusion and requires immediate follow up. 


Case Study Question 2 of 6 
A 26-year-old woman presents in the emergency department with a sudden onset of lightheadedness and generalized weakness of the left lower and upper extremities.  




For each finding, click to specify if the finding is a risk factor or not a risk factor for ischemic stroke. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Efforts to reduce the onset of stroke remain a focal point for healthcare providers. A healthy lifestyle that addresses modifiable risk factors such as physical activity (40 minutes per day, 3 – 4 days/week), alcohol consumption in moderation, and healthy eating practices can reduce the onset of a stroke. Age, race, and gender are nonmodifiable risk factors for a stroke. African Americans and some Hispanic/Latino Americans have a higher stroke and mortality when compared to Caucasian Americans. Combined hormonal contraceptive is a birth control that contains estrogen to prevent ovulation by altering the cervical mucus and uterine lining. Exogenous estrogens impact the skeletal, metabolic, and coagulation systems, thereby increasing the risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack. Vape contains nicotine as an active ingredient and increases the risk of developing a blood clot, stroke, or heart attack while using estrogen.  

Case Study Question 3 of 6 
A 26-year-old woman presents in the emergency department with a sudden onset of lightheadedness and generalized weakness of the left lower and upper extremities.

The top priority for this client is  



Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: An interruption of blood flow to the brain because of a thrombotic or embolic event can lead to the onset of an ischemic stroke.  The main nursing priority with a client experiencing an ischemic stroke is to restore cerebral perfusion to prevent further neurological deficits, altered level of consciousness, or death of the cells. 








Case Study Question 4 of 6 
A 26-year-old woman presents in the emergency department with a sudden onset of lightheadedness and generalized weakness of the left lower and upper extremities.  


The nurse reviews the healthcare provider’s orders and plans to administer alteplase.
What additional assessment data should the nurse obtain before administering alteplase? Select all that apply.
No current pregnancy   *
Blood glucose is greater than 50 mg/dL*
No major surgical procedures within 14 days *
Recent international travel 
Serum pH is greater than 7.35
Confirm onset and timeframe of symptoms*
Serum potassium greater than 3.5 mEq/L
Can safely ambulate to the bathroom  
Client weight*



Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Thrombolytic therapy, alteplase or recombinant t-Pa, dissolves the clot and is used once an ischemic stroke is determined. Dose is weight dependent. A thorough assessment to diagnose stroke and initiating thrombolytic therapy within 3 hours lessens the stroke's magnitude and improves the brain's overall function and outcomes three months after the stroke. Contraindications to thrombolytic treatment include but are not limited to if symptoms started longer ago than 3-hours, having a major surgical procedure within the last 14 days, current pregnancy, blood glucose less than 50 mg/dL, and receiving heparin in the past 48 hours.

For each possible action, click to specify if it is indicated or not indicated after administering alteplase.


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Clients who receive thrombolytic therapy are admitted to an intensive care unit for continuous cardiac monitoring and close observation for bleeding; therefore, oral anticoagulants are withheld for the next 24 hours. Insertion of nasogastric tubes, urinary catheters, and intra-arterial pressure catheters is delayed for 24 hours. Vital signs are recorded and documented every 15 minutes for the first two hours, then every 30 minutes for the next six hours, and then every hour until 24 hours after treatment to monitor for intracerebral hemorrhage and other signs of bleeding. Serum glucose blood levels should be assessed and maintained within 140 to 180 mg/dL. Efforts to reduce hypoglycemia are also significant. Poor neurological outcomes in acute stroke have been associated with hyperglycemia.

A 26-year-old woman presents in the emergency department with a sudden onset of lightheadedness and generalized weakness of the left lower and upper extremity.  




The client’s condition has improved the next day and the nurse evaluates the client’s understanding of the instructions provided. 

Click to specify whether the statement indicates an understanding, or no understanding of the teaching provided. 


Scoring Rule: 0/1

Rationale: Thrombolytic agents are designed to dissolve the thrombi to help reestablish blood flow to reduce injury and death of the neural cells. Like other anticoagulant agents, the risk of bleeding is a significant adverse effect. To prevent a fall, the nurse should instruct the client to call someone to help her get out of bed. An ischemic stroke can cause dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) due to impairment of the mouth, tongue, palate, larynx, pharynx, and upper esophagus, therefore, a swallow evaluation should be completed within 4 to 24 hours. The speech and swallow evaluation will determine if the client should have thin or thicken liquids or pureed foods to prevent aspiration. The client should take the necessary precaution to reduce bleeding by switching to an electric razor or brushing their teeth with a soft bristle toothbrush to reduce bleeding at the gumline. Combined hormonal contraception contains the estrogen hormone that influences fibrinogen in the plasma, specifically factor VII and X, thereby increasing the risk of stroke, bleeding, and heart attack. The client should inquire about other alternatives to prevent pregnancy. A baseline assessment of the client’s functional ability is important to determine the motor, social, and cognitive function. This assessment is completed by the nurse. The client should plan to take apixaban, an oral anticoagulant used to treat and prevent blood clots to prevent a stroke. Clients with type II diabetes should plan to monitor their blood glucose and if indicated self-administer insulin as prescribed.

Complete the diagram by dragging from the choices below to specify what condition the client is most likely experiencing, 2 actions the nurse should take to address that condition, and 2 parameters the nurse should monitor to assess the client's progress.


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The client is showing symptoms of an ischemic stroke. Use of combined hormonal contraceptive is birth control that contains estrogen is a major risk factor for stroke in young adults. Once the determination is made that the client is experiencing a neurological deficit as seen with an ischemic stroke, the nurse should initiate a code stroke which activates and coordinates a rapid team response with the radiologist who will interpret the CT scan results immediately to determine the type of stroke, analyze of blood work within a specified timeframe, and obtain a consultation by a Neurologist. The overarching goal with initiating a code stroke is achieving, sustaining, and improving client outcomes by minimizing any neurological deficits. The lack of blood flow to the cells can cause cell injury and cell death with delayed care. To reduce the effects of an ischemic stroke, administering supplemental oxygen is critical in preventing cell death. Management of the airway is a nursing priority for the client experiencing an acute stroke as these clients are at risk of developing dysphagia. The nurse should monitor and assess the patency of the airway and functioning. The nurse should continue to reassess the client’s neurological status. A decrease in the level of consciousness is indicative of intracranial pressure (ICP) or poor cerebral perfusion.

The nurse receives orders to admit the client to the behavior health unit for suicide risk.
 For each potential intervention, click to specify whether the intervention is indicated or not indicated for suicide precautions.  

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The room should be prepared with limited linen, removal of all sharp objects, and removal of unnecessary cables, cords, and equipment when a client is on suicide precautions. There is not necessarily a restriction on staff or visitors. Visitors should be screened, and a Chaplin can be consulted per the client request. It is important to conduct frequent safety assessments, but vital signs every 5 minutes and restraints are not necessary currently.

Key

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Magnesium toxicity is characterized by respiratory depression, decreased urinary output, and loss of deep tendon reflexes. Cutaneous flushing and sweating are expected side effects of magnesium administration and are not concerning. Blood pressure at 0900 is expected since the client has severe preeclampsia. Magnesium infusion can cause hypotension.

The nurse is caring for a client admitted to the labor and delivery unit at 35 weeks gestation with preeclampsia.

For each potential intervention, click to specify whether the intervention is indicated or not indicated to include in the plan of care.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: When magnesium toxicity is suspected the infusion should be stopped, a rapid response activated, and calcium gluconate administered.  The patient should receive oxygen because of respiratory depression. The fetus should be assessed any time there is a complication with the mother. Serum magnesium would confirm toxicity. Checking for medication error is necessary after medication-related complications. Supine position could make shortness of breath worse. Anti-seizure medication would be necessary for eclampsia, which this client does not have.  Elevation of extremities is unrelated to magnesium toxicity.

Case Study Question 1 of 6
The nurse cares for a term newborn on the first day of life on the postpartum unit.

Drag the 5 findings that need immediate follow-up to the box on the right.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Bilirubin is produced by the breakdown of hemoglobin.  A build-up of bilirubin in the body causes a yellow skin color called jaundice.  Jaundice and yellow sclera are signs of hyperbilirubinemia. This is urgent as high bilirubin can cause brain damage and death.  This combined with the dry mucous membranes, and slightly depressed fontanelle may indicate the newborn is developing hypovolemia. Both hypovolemia and hyperbilirubinemia can cause lethargy. Epstein pearls are very small keratin cysts that appear in the mouths of more than 50% of newborns. Epstein pearls are benign and disappear after a few weeks. A clamped umbilicus is normal. Passing 1 stool and voiding once on day  1 are typical findings/ The vital signs are within normal limits for a newborn.

Case Study Question 2 of 6 
The nurse cases for a term newborn on the first day of life on the postpartum unit.

For each client finding click to indicate it is a risk factor or not a risk factor for jaundice.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale. Hyperbilirubinemia can come from increased bilirubin production and or delayed excretion. The majority of bilirubin is produced from the breakdown of hemoglobin into unconjugated bilirubin. Unconjugated bilirubin binds to albumin in the blood for transport to the liver, where it is taken up by hepatocytes and conjugated to make it water-soluble so it can be excreted in stool and urine. Breastfeeding problems that lead to inadequate intake, and poor hydration, evidenced by the dry mucous membranes and depressed fontanelles, can result in decreased excretion of bilirubin. Rh incompatibility occurs when a mother who is type Rh - gives birth to an infant who is Rh+ and develops anti-Rh antibodies in her serum. The antibodies attack the infant’s blood cells, causing the cells to lyse and producing a hemolytic anemia. The development of antibodies typically happens during the birthing process, so antibodies are present in subsequent pregnancies. Passing 1 stool in the first day of life is an expected finding and would not be considered a risk factor. The length of rupture of membranes was typical and would not be considered a risk factor. 

Case Study Question 3 of 6
The nurse cases for a term newborn on the first day of life on the postpartum unit.

The nurse reviews the laboratory results. 
Complete the following sentence by choosing from the list of options.

Scoring Rule: Rationale
Rationale: Visible jaundice on the first day of life and the high bilirubin level rising more than 5mg/dL a day indicate pathological jaundice. The direct antiglobulin test shows that there are maternal Rh antibodies adhering to the infant’s Rh+ red blood cells lysing the cells. Untreated, this will lead to a hemolytic anemia and possible kernicterus. Poor intake an excretion can complicate the problem but are not the underlying cause of the pathological jaundice.

The nurse contacts the physician with the assessment and laboratory findings.  

Select the nursing action(s) from each of the categories the nurse should anticipate including in the plan of care. Each category may have one or more nursing action(s).


Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Phototherapy lights can cause retinal damage, hyperthermia, and bronzed baby syndrome. The nurse must plan interventions to decrease the risk of these adverse effects of therapy. Dehydration is another potential complication of phototherapy. Phototherapy increases insensible water losses. To maximize time under the lights, it is recommended that the baby not be removed from under the phototherapy lights for more than 20 minutes every 3-4 hours. This can interfere with feeding. A lactation consultant can help the breastfeeding parent maximize the efficiency of the time breastfeeding. The nurse should monitor the neonate’s hydration status by weighing the diapers. Although this neonate is struggling to breastfeed, supplementing feedings with formula are not the first choice as they may interfere with establishing breastfeeding.

The nurse has received orders and updates the plan of care.  
Click to specify if the nurse should implement the orders immediately, before the end of the shift, or by discharge.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Immediately – Based on the total serum bilirubin level phototherapy should be initiated. 
Before end of shift –A lactation consultation is needed to improve breast feeding to help prevent dehydration and increase stooling to help excrete bilirubin. Parents will need to know how to interact with their infant while they are receiving phototherapy. Parents will need to understand the disease process as a rationale for the therapy needed and adherence to recommendations for time spent under phototherapy. 
By discharge – Once the baby is discharged, follow-up total serum bilirubin levels may be needed to assess for rebound hyperbilirubinemia.


Case Study Question 6 of 6  
The nurse cases for a term newborn on the first day of life on the postpartum unit.

The nurse reassesses the client 2 hours after starting phototherapy and implementing the treatment plan.


For each finding, click to specify if the finding indicates that the client’s status has improved, declined, or is unchanged. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Breastfeeding has improved because the baby is able to latch now and has voided and stooled. The increased bilirubin levels after phototherapy shows a decline. The development of backward arching may indicate opisthotonos which develops as increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin cross the blood brain barrier and the bilirubin adheres to the neural cells in the brain. Opisthotonos is a sign of severe neurological damage. The sclera was yellow prior to beginning phototherapy and remains unchanged.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Bilirubin encephalopathy is caused by an extreme buildup of bilirubin in the brain. It is a medical emergency, and if treatment to bring down bilirubin levels is not initiated quickly, it can cause permanent brain damage. High values of indirect free bilirubin in the blood which couldn’t bind to albumin can transfer from the blood-brain barrier and precipitate in the brain cells and disturb the normal central nervous system function. Nurses must monitor the TSB level every 4-6 hours until levels start to decrease and notify the health care provided if therapeutic interventions are not effective. Diminished reflex responses in the neonate indicate a worsening neurologic outcome. Intensive phototherapy (two lights and a bili-blanket, should be initiated first. If levels do not respond in a few hours, or TSB are over the recommended levels, an exchange transfusion should be initiated.

A 16-year-old male student faints during gym class at the end of the school day and is brought to the nursing office.

Click to highlight the findings that require immediate follow-up. 


K Key. 

Scoring Rule: +/-ey
Rationale: Immediate follow-up is needed regarding the cardiac concerns and pallor. The headache is a concern but likely a secondary symptom. The student is alert and oriented, and vital signs are normal except for the heart rate. Sweating is not a major concern at this time as it could be a result of gym class.

Case Study Question 2 of 6 
A 16-year-old male student faints during gym class at the end of the school day and is brought to the nursing office 

For each finding click to indicate if the finding is consistent with heat exhaustion, hypoglycemia, cannabis use. Each  finding may support more than one condition. 
Note: Each column must have at least 1 response option selected. 
Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Hypoglycemia and heat exhaustion explain nearly all the assessment findings, apart from hunger not being a symptom of heat exhaustion. Cannabis use also does not explain all the symptoms even though a 16-year-old may participate in risk taking activities such as this, however, the student being alert and oriented make this less likely.

Case Study Question 3 of 6 
A 16-year-old male student faints during gym class at the end of the school day and is brought to the nursing office.

What is the top priority for the nurse to address? 
Administer glucose
Contacting the parents
Determining last insulin use
Obtaining a blood glucose level*

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Understanding this student has type 1 diabetes, the initial focus is to determine where the current blood glucose level is to determine course of treatment.






Case Study Question 4 of 6 
A 16-year-old male student faints during gym class at the end of the school day and is brought to the nursing office.

The nurse obtains a point of care blood glucose.  

Select the orders from each of the categories the nurse should include in the plan of care. Each category may have more than one order.

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: If the student remains alert and oriented ingesting carbohydrates such as orange juice or candy is appropriate along with rechecking blood glucose. Glucagon may be indicated if blood glucose still is low after treatment. A STAT call to EMS/911 is not indicated at this time as the student remains alert and oriented. Fast-acting insulin is not indicated as it would drop the blood glucose even further.
Case Study Question 5 of 6 
A 16-year-old male student faints during gym class at the end of the school day and is brought to the nursing office.

The nurse reviews the student’s emergency orders.

What would be appropriate sources of glucose to give the student? Select all that apply
1 tablespoon (15 grams) of sugar*
3 glucose tablets*
A full-sized candy bar
A can of soda (8oz or 240mL)
Half cup of fruit juice (4oz or 120mL) *
A bag of pork rinds (3oz)

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Understanding the 15/15 rule for treatment of hypoglycemia, the half cup of fruit juice, 1 tablespoon of sugar and 3 glucose tablets are all within that 15-gram range for the student to ingest. The full-sized candy bar and can of soda are both greater than 15 grams and the pork rinds are not a good option because they have low to zero carbohydrates. 
Case Study Question 6 of 6 
A 16-year-old male student faints during gym class at the end of the school day and is brought to the nursing office.
After 15 minutes since carbohydrates were given student’s blood glucose reassessed.
Complete the following sentence by choosing from the list of options.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Initial treatment with 15 grams of carbohydrates given orally was unsuccessful in raising the student’s blood glucose. The student is now becoming disoriented and will not be able to take more oral glucose and waiting 15 minutes to recheck without treatment will not aid the student. The nurse needs to prepare to administer glucagon as the student’s status is deteriorating.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Student has symptoms that relate to hypoglycemia, it would be important to check the student’s history and obtain a blood glucose at this time. Student pulse is elevated and should continue to be monitored and the student is currently speaking and oriented this would need to continue to be monitored to make sure no changes in orientation occur.

Click to highlight the findings that are most significant


Key

 Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: It is important to note that the child has what appears to be a typical illness, and not other more serious symptoms. The seizure symptoms including unresponsiveness, rigidity and shaking of limbs are typical for tonic clonic febrile seizure. Seizure length is important to note, seizures longer than 15 minutes are typically recommended for ER transfer.

The telehealth nurse in an outpatient clinic receives a call from the parent of a 4- year- old child who may have had a seizure

Identify the top 4 priorities for the triage nurse to ask the parent and drag to the column on the right.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The nurse needs to identify if the child is in immediate physical or physiologic danger. In a triage setting this is often completed by standard questions. The child’s birth history, intake and output and developmental status are not priorities. The nurse will need to know if the child has any underlying medical conditions or has received any medications recently.

Drag the most appropriate word from the choices to fill in the blank of the following sentence. 
The top priority for the nurse to address is


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The child’s neurologic status remains impaired. Current respiratory status appears stable, and the infection and intake and output are not the highest priority.



Case Study Question 4 of 6 
The telehealth nurse in an outpatient clinic receives a call from the parent of a 4- year- old child who may have had a seizure

The client is diagnosed with a febrile seizure.
For each potential intervention, click to specify whether the order is appropriate or  not appropriate  to include in the plan of care.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: It is expected for a child to remain lethargic post seizure. While very lethargic, no oral medications or fluids should be attempted. Fever is best managed with an antipyretic, and rectal route if available is best for the neurologically altered child. A cool bath is never indicated for fever management. At this point, MRI, antiepileptic and antibiotic are not indicated. The nurse should instruct the parent to maintain safe positioning while the child is altered, and schedule to see the physician as soon as possible.
Case Study Question 5 of 6 
The telehealth nurse in an outpatient clinic receives a call from the parent of a 4- year- old child who may have had a seizure.

The provider enters orders.

What should the nurse teach the client about the treatment plan?  Select all that apply.


Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: The nurse should convey importance of safety/continued monitoring of the child’s condition, appropriate fever management and follow up as needed. Febrile seizures are not contagious although the underlying illness causing the fever could be contagious. Febrile seizures typically resolve in early childhood and do not require ongoing medical management. 120 mg of acetaminophen is subtherapeutic for the child’s weight.

Case Study Question 6 of 6 
The telehealth nurse in an outpatient clinic receives a call from the parent of a 4- year- old child who may have had a seizure.

The nurse provides education on febrile seizures and treatment plan.
For each client statement, click to specify whether the statement indicates an understanding, or no understanding of teaching provided. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The child with a febrile seizure may need closer monitoring while ill or potentially febrile as one febrile seizure can be predictive of future febrile seizures. Children typically experience febrile seizures as infants or young children (1-4 years old) and outgrow febrile seizures with no remaining deficits or neurologic issues and do not need chronic antiepileptics. Rectal acetaminophen is not necessary for the child who is able to take oral medications but may be needed for the child who is neurologically impaired or lethargic.

Trend 
The telehealth nurse in an outpatient clinic receives a call from the parent of a 4- year- old child who may have had a seizure.

Complete the following sentence by choosing from the list of options.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Improved mental status indicates that the child is recovering. The child will not need seizure medications as febrile seizures typically do not warrant antiepileptics and further antipyretics should not be administered prior to 6 hours from previous dose.

The nurse is caring for a 82-year-old female admitted to the medical unit with dehydration and new onset of urinary incontinence and mild confusion. 

Drag the 4 findings that need immediate follow-up to the box on the right.
Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale:  The poor skin turgor is indicative of hypovolemia/dehydration (poor PO fluid intake in past week per daughter) . The temperature and slightly elevated WBC along with new incontinence of concentrated, pink-tinged urine and new onset of mild confusion indicate urinary tract infection. Client does not report pain/burning with urination but these overall findings  are consistent with atypical presentation of UTI in older adults.

For each finding, click to indicate if the finding is consistent with the conditions of dehydration or urinary tract infection.  Each finding may support more than one condition. 
Note: Each column must have at least 1 response option selected. 
Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: This older adult client is experiencing many symptoms of dehydration and urinary tract infection; some risk factors/findings are linked to the development of both conditions while other factors/findings are indicative of one or the other.  New onset of mild confusion and incontinence  are examples of atypical presentation in lieu of other typical signs of pain/burning on urination.

























Case Study Question 3 of 6 
The nurse is caring for a 82-year-old female admitted to the medical unit with dehydration and new onset of urinary incontinence and mild confusion. 

 Which problem should the nurse address first?  
Confusion
Dehydration
Urinary tract infection* 
Incontinence
Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: The client is experiencing a urinary tract infection as evidenced by elevated temperature, increased WBC and bacteriuria with foul-smelling, blood-tinged urine.  New onset of incontinence and restlessness/acute confusion can be atypical symptoms and should subside once UTI addressed. Dehydration, while a contributing factor, is slightly lower priority. The infection must be addressed aggressively as older clients, due to atypical presentation/delay in diagnosis, are at high risk to develop sepsis/septic shock (urosepsis).

Case Study Question 4 of 6 
The nurse is caring for a 82-year-old female admitted to medical unit with dehydration and new onset of urinary incontinence and mild confusion.

Strict bedrest
Encourage PO fluids*
Document intake & output*
Monitor urinary color, character and odor*
Request order for Foley catheter if incontinent
Apply prn oxygen at 2 L/min per nasal cannula

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale:  Given the client’s main problems are dehydration and UTI, the normal saline fluid challenge, antibiotic, acetaminophen are appropriate orders.   The nurse would also monitor urine color/character for improvement As Foley catheters can be a source/risk for UTI, this would also be contraindicated in this case. Pulse oximetry is greater than 95 on room air, therefore no prn oxygen is needed.


Case Study Question 5 of 6 
The nurse is caring for a 82-year-old female admitted to medical unit with dehydration and new onset of urinary incontinence and mild confusion. 

What action should the nurse take before administering the prescribed antibiotic?


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale:  Before administering the prescribed antibiotic, the nurse should check for any medication allergies.The daughter has noted sulfa allergy and the nurse should also rule out any allergies to penicillin or other antibiotics  ordered to treat UTI.

Case Study Question 1 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 78-year-old female admitted to the medical intensive care unit in respiratory distress.

Which 4 findings are most urgent?  

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The client has signs and symptoms of infection and respiratory failure.  The most urgent findings are related to respiratory failure. Those include a pH of 7.2 indicating an acidic state, PCO2 > 50, tachypnea (rr 30 bpm), and a pulse oximeter reading of 87% on high flow oxygen. The blood pressure is elevated but is not yet critical.
Case Study Question 2 of 6

For each finding click to indicate if the finding is consistent with Acute Respiratory Failure or Pneumonia. Each finding may support more than one condition. 
Note: Each column must have at least 1 response option selected. 
Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Bilateral crackles can be associated with both respiratory conditions and are common in respiratory illnesses. A pulse oximeter reading of 87% indicates there is a low level of oxygen within the blood which can be caused by either condition. A PCO2 of 51 and pH of 7.2 indicates respiratory acidosis and are consistent with acute respiratory failure. 

Case Study Question 3 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 78-year-old female admitted to the medical intensive care unit in respiratory distress.

What does the nurse determine is the priority for this client’s care?
Administering corticosteroids to reduce inflammation
Intubating for mechanical ventilation support*
Opening airways with aerosol treatments
Treating infection with antibiotics

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Acute respiratory failure is characterized by the lung tissue’s inability to oxygenate properly. The client has had a poor response to maximum supplemental oxygen and now needs mechanical ventilation. The respiratory failure was most likely caused by pneumonia. Treating pneumonia should take place next.  Aerosols and corticosteroids may be incorporated into the treatment plan but are not as critical as intubation.

The nurse plans care for the client after beginning mechanical ventilation.
For each potential intervention, click to specify whether the intervention is indicated or not indicated to include in the plan of care.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Most  intubated clients require sedation to prevent them from fighting the ventilator. A chest x-ray should be done after intubation to confirm endotracheal tube placement. Suctioning can be damaging to tracheal tissue and should be done as needed and not on a schedule. Antibiotics are indicated to fight infection. Amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic, would not be indicated for this client because no arrhythmia was identified. Positioning the client supine would not be indicated. Semi fowlers or prone would be best to help with postural drainage. The client has tachycardia and elevated blood pressure which makes obtaining an electrocardiogram important.

Key
Click to highlight the 3 orders the nurse should  specify if the nurse should implement next.

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: A chest X-ray is needed after intubation determine optimal endotracheal tube placement. The client does not yet have venous access. This should be established immediately so medications can be given. The B/P and heart rate are significantly elevated, and the client is agitated. Sedation should be given to decrease agitation and risk of self- extubation. Next an EKG can be done, and antibiotics can be given. The oxygen level is above 95% so adjustments are not needed and there is no indication suctioning is needed. The blood gas is not due. The urinary catheter can be placed after other treatments.  

Case Study Question 6 of 6

The nurse reassesses the client at 1000 and compares the findings to 0930.
For each finding, click to specify if the finding indicates that the client’s status has improved, declined, or is unchanged. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The heart rate decreased from 110 to 100 and blood pressure dropped from 180/90 to 150/70; both indicate improvement. The client is drowsy showing the agitation has decreased.  The client’s temperature and respiratory rate remain unchanged. The client’s pulse oximeter has declined slightly. The nurse should assess the lungs sounds to determine if suctioning or ventilator increases are needed.

Case Study Question 1 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 12- hour- old late-preterm male with respiratory distress following a home birth.

Which 3 findings require immediate follow-up? 
Urine output
Temperature*
Birth weight
Respiratory status*
Pain
Heart rate
Oxygen saturation*

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The newborn has respiratory distress as evidenced by the low oxygen saturation, elevated respiratory rate >60 and increased work of breathing (grunting, retracting, nasal flaring). The newborn also has a low temperature which could be causing cold stress. The resting heart rate is slightly elevated (normal resting rate 110-160). The infant is large for gestational age and a blood glucose should be obtained. There is no mention of pain. Urine output is irrelevant at this time, since the newborn is only 12 hours old. Excepted urinary output for the first day of life is once in 24 hours.

Note: each column must have at least 1 finding
Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Grunting, hypotonic muscle tone, tachypnea, and hypoglycemia are evidence of respiratory distress syndrome. Hypothermia, tachypnea, & lethargy are evidence of infection. Symptoms of neonatal abstinence syndrome involve the GI tract and central nervous system, the newborn would be irritable not lethargic with NAS. Central cyanosis, lethargy and tachypnea are all signs of congenital heart disease.

The condition the client is most likely experiencing is 
which untreated can lead to  

Scoring Rule: Rationale
Rationale: Chest x-ray demonstrated ground glass appearance that gives the strongest evidence that the hypo aeration is due to a lack of surfactant. ABG results demonstrate metabolic acidosis but do not reveal the cause. Left untreated the newborn will eventually develop atelectasis. The lab work is not reflective of infection WBC normal. The newborn is not demonstrating withdraw symptoms…irritability, yawning, high-pitched cry.

For each potential intervention clinic to indicate if it indicated or contraindicated.


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The newborn has a diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome. Surfactant administration is the main treatment with respiratory support. Newborn is intubated for administration of  the surfactant and airway support. Cluster care to reduce oxygen demands. Oral feedings are contraindicated in newborn with tachypnea. Suctioning airway hourly can actually increase respiratory distress. IV placement is necessary for access. This causative issue is not lung edema (secretions), so chest physiotherapy would not be indicated. It would be Important to maintain a neutral thermal environment to reduce metabolic needs.

Which one of the following interventions should the nurse implement first?
Obtain a repeat blood glucose.
Assist with intubation.*
Suction the newborns airway.
Administer surfactant.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
 Rationale: Maintaining a patent airway is the priorities. Surfactant cannot be administered until the newborn is intubated. Suctioning the newborns airway, is not indicated. The blood glucose level can be addressed after surfactant is given. The priority is intubation, to allow access for the administration of surfactant. A lack of surfactant is the causative issue in this case.

Case Study Question 1 of 6 
The nurse prepares a client with depression for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the outpatient surgery center. 

Click to highlight the findings that require immediate follow-up.
Key

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: The RN should seek a translator; it is not acceptable to utilize the patient’s spouse for this elective procedure. It is not acceptable for the provider to not obtain a translator because the client may not fully understand the procedure. While the client’s anxiety is not normal, the cause of this is likely related to the language barrier and fear of not knowing what is going on. 

Case Study Question 2 of 6 
The nurse prepares a client with depression for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the outpatient surgery center.

Which of the following complications is the client at risk for experiencing? Select all that apply.
The wrong procedure *
The wrong medications 
Lack of knowledge about risks and benefits of the procedure *
Lack of knowledge on the provider’s credentials 
Procedure performed on the wrong patient *
Procedure performed without insurance approval 

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: The client is at risk for not comprehending his procedure today along with the risks and benefits of the procedure if the provider continues to allow the spouse to translate. Without proper informed consent it could be possible that the provider performs the wrong procedure or the procedure on the wrong client. Obtaining informed consent is a critical step prior to the start of procedures requiring anesthesia for patient safety. 

Case Study Question 3 of 6 
The nurse prepares a client with depression for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the outpatient surgery center. 

Which problem should the nurse address first? 
Assessing spouses’ ability to translate  
Rescheduling procedure for next day  
Confronting the provider 
Obtaining an approved interpreter *

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The client is at risk for having the wrong procedure conducted and not addressing his concerns about the procedure without obtaining informed consent properly. The provider is not willing to obtain an interpreter due to lack of time, but this is a safety issue. The spouse is not a certified interpreter and there is the ability that the message is not being relayed correct to the client. Therefore, obtaining an interpreter is the first thing the nurse should address. 
Case Study Question 4 of 6 
The nurse prepares a client with depression for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the outpatient surgery center.  

The RN participants in obtaining informed consent for the client. 
For each potential intervention, click to specify whether the intervention is indicated or not indicated for the RN regarding informed consent for this client.
Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The role of the RN in informed consent includes determining the level of understanding about the procedure, identifying any fears/misconceptions, and notifying the provider. The RN should provide information about the nursing care associated with the procedure and contact the provider if there is doubt the patient’s understanding of the procedure. It is important the RN witness the client giving consent voluntary and competently. 


Case Study Question 5 of 6 
The nurse prepares a client with depression for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the outpatient surgery center.

What should the nurse teach the family about informed consent? Select all that apply
The RN can obtain this for the provider if they are busy 
If an official translator cannot be found, it is okay to use your spouse
The provider must inform you of any risks and benefits of the procedure*
Once you sign the consent form you cannot ask further questions 
Consent can be withdrawn at any time*
The provider must inform you to any alternatives to the treatment*
Obtaining consent is about client autonomy*
Your spouse can sign for you if you’re scared

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: It is important that the provider obtain informed consent addressing the procedure and highlights the risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure. If a language barrier is present, it is important to use an approved interpreter and not the client’s spouse. The client must be the one to sign the informed consent autonomously unless they are unable to do so, in which the client’s  power of attorney can sign the consent form. 

Case Study Question 6 of 6 
The nurse prepares a client with depression for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the outpatient surgery center.

The translator for the client is relaying the following statements from the client about the ECT procedure. 
For each client statement, click to specify whether the statement indicates an understanding, or no understanding of teaching provided. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The client must sign the informed consent prior to the start of the procedure but can change their mind about going through with the procedure at any time. The results of studies relating to the mechanism underlying the effectiveness of ECT continue to be controversial and depression will not necessarily continue if the client does not undergo the ECT. Confusion/memory loss, brain damage, and even mortality can occur from the ECT procedure. There are several risks that need to be discussed with the client prior to the procedure.

For each finding click to specify if the finding is consistent with the complication of  hemorrhagic shock, fluid overload, or pulmonary embolism. Each finding may support more than one disease process.  Each column must have at least one correct response.

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: All  three  post-op complications can cause low oxygenation. The nurse recognizes signs pulmonary embolism and hemorrhagic shock  manifest as mental changes, tachycardia,  and hypotension, and low blood pressure.  The red urine indicates active bleeding and is associated with  hemorrhagic shock.

Case Study Question 4 of 6 
A 55-year-old client is admitted to the surgical unit after robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for early-stage prostate cancer. 

The nurse suspects the client is experiencing hemorrhagic shock and notifies the provider. 
For each potential intervention, click to specify whether the intervention is not appropriate or not appropriate to include in the plan of care for a client who is experiencing hemorrhagic shock after prostatectomy.



Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The catheter should remain in place and the provider should apply traction to the catheter to put pressure on the sites that may be bleeding. The nurse should implement measures to restore perfusion which include applying oxygen and giving a fluid bolus. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels should be drawn to help determine if blood is needed. Urine output should continue to be monitored closely to ensure the urethra is patent, and renal perfusion is adequate.  Urine cultures are unlikely to be helpful at this since infection is not suspected and the urine is bloody. Edemas are contraindicated as they may injure the prostatic fossa.

Case Study Question 1 of 6 
The nurse is caring for a 23-year-old female client admitted to the medical-surgical unit following surgery for a compound fracture of the right tibia and fibula.

The nurse is performing a neurovascular assessment of the right lower extremity. 
Which findings require immediate follow-up? Select all that apply

Toes on the affected extremity are cool to the touch*
Unable to palpate pedal pulses on the right leg
Right toes have noticeable pallor compared to the left*
Client describes absent sensation of the right lower leg*
Capillary refill greater than 3 seconds to right toes*
Client reports pain of 10/10 to R lower extremity*
Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Primary signs of compartment syndrome include the “5 P’s,” Pain (out of proportion/not relieved with pain medication), Pallor, Pulses (diminished or absent), Paresthesia, Paralysis. Additionally, fullness, cool or cold extremity, and weakness may occur. Any of these symptoms are indicative of neurovascular compromise. If untreated could result in tissue death and loss of limb. The pedal pulse will not be able to be assessed due to the cast. 


Case Study Question 2 of 6 
The nurse is caring for a 23-year-old female client admitted to the medical-surgical unit following surgery for a compound fracture of the right tibia and fibula.

The nurse indicates “Will monitor for signs of acute complications.”
For each potential complication of a fracture click to indicate if the complication is an acute complication or a chronic complication associated with fractures. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The nurse should differentiate between acute complications of a fracture and chronic or late complications. Acute complications include deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, fat embolism, and compartment syndrome. Late, or chronic complications include complex regional pain syndrome, avascular necrosis, osteomyelitis, and delayed union. 


Case Study Question 3 of 6

The Neurovascular Assessment and Nurses’ Notes have been updated to reflect the current assessment findings.
Complete the following sentence by choosing from the list of options.

Scoring Rule: Rationale
Rationale: Compartment syndrome is suspected based on the abnormal findings in the neurovascular assessment. While some of the vital signs are abnormal, and the client is tachycardic there can be causes other than compartment syndrome for these findings.


Case Study Question 4 of 6 
The nurse is caring for a 23-year-old female client admitted to the medical-surgical unit following surgery for a compound fracture of the right tibia and fibula.

The nurse suspects the client is developing compartment syndrome and prepares for the provider to reassess the client.
Based on the assessment findings and recent vital signs, select the orders from each of the categories the nurse would anticipate being included in the plan of care. Each category may have more than one order included.

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: The nurse should prioritize interventions that would relieve pressure within the compartment, monitor for improving or declining condition, and treat potential life or limb threatening conditions. This would include frequent neurovascular assessments and preparing to remove the cast as soon as possible by getting the cast removal saw to the bedside. The provider is likely to insert a compartment pressure measurement manometer to assess compartmental pressures. Client should be kept NPO in the event surgery is required. Pain medication such as morphine is indicated, and due to hypotension an IV fluid bolus is indicated. Ibuprofen is not effective for the pain rate of 10/10, and 400 mg would not be a therapeutic dose. Aspirin is contraindicated due to the anticoagulation component if the client needs surgery. The surgical team should be consulted. Client would not be instructed on crutch walking at this time until the compartment syndrome is resolved. Respiratory and Case Management for long-term care are not indicated at this time.


Case Study Question 5 of 6 
The nurse is caring for a 23-year-old female client admitted to the medical-surgical unit following surgery for a compound fracture of the right tibia and fibula.


The nurse has reviewed updated orders placed by provider.
Which orders can the nurse delegate to the Unlicensed Assistive Personnel(UAP)? Select all that Apply.


Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: To accomplish all the tasks needed to care for this client the nurse may delegate some tasks to  the UAP. The UAP is unable to perform assessments or monitor neurovascular status. t is the nurses’ responsibility to ensure client is ready for surgery. The pre-operative checklist may be used to ensure all pre-operative criteria is met. Measuring and documenting VS, Intake and Output, height and weight may all be done by the UAP. The UAP may also help the client to maintain the extremity in the proper position as instructed by the Nurse.


Case Study Question 6 of 6 
The nurse is caring for a 23-year-old female client admitted to the medical-surgical unit following surgery for a compound fracture of the right tibia and fibula.

For each finding, click to specify if the finding indicates that the client’s status has improved, declined, or is unchanged since the onset of symptoms. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The nurse determines the client’s Pain rate, motion and color are improving since the onset of symptoms (1100) as evidenced by the data in the neurovascular assessment. The pulse and temperature declined, and the sensation and capillary refill remained unchanged.
















Trend Template 
The nurse is caring for a 23-year-old female client admitted to the medical-surgical unit who developed compartment syndrome following surgery for a compound fracture of the right tibia and fibula.

The nurse reassesses the client every 15 minutes for 1 hour after cast removal. 
Complete the following sentence by choosing from the list of options.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: While some of the assessment have remained unchanged the extremity has gotten increasingly cool to the touch and the pulse is now absent. These findings may necessitate further action, and the physician should be notified immediately in case the client will need a surgical fasciotomy to restore adequate perfusion to the affected extremity, as there is evidence neurovascular compromise is still present.

Rationale: The child is at risk for fluid overload leading to hypertension and cardio- pulmonary  congestion leading to heart failure. Untreated the decreased urine output, hematuria, and high blood pressure  can lead to renal failure. Gastrointestinal, endocrine, and hepatic complications are not known ramifications of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.

The parent brings a 6-year-old male child to the emergency department with new symptoms after completing treatment for strep throat.

Labs return and the child receives the diagnosis of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.
Complete the sentence from the list of drop-down options.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The top priority is to manage the fluid overload. Managing the overload will help the blood pressure. The nurse will anticipate orders to treat the infection, however the problem is being caused by an immune response not an infection.


Case Study Question 4 of 6 
The parent brings a 6-year-old male child brought to the emergency department with new symptoms after completing treatment for strep throat.

The nurse on the pediatric unit anticipates admitting the client. 
Select the orders from each of the categories the nurse should anticipate including in the plan of care. Each category may have more than one order. 

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: The child is experiencing poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.  Treatment will include antibiotics for positive Group A streptococcal infection and diuretic therapy for fluid overload and hypertension. Antihypertensives will be added as needed. Other treatment will include strict I&O, sodium and fluid restrictions, and neuro checks every 6 hours due to risk of development of seizures and encephalopathy.

Case Study Question 5 of 6 
Six-year-old male with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is admitted to the pediatric unit.

The nurse plans the family teaching about the treatment plan.
For each teaching point, click to specify if the nurse should address the teaching immediately upon admission, within the next hour, or before the end of the shift.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: When teaching is complex, teaching should be broken down into short segments. Upon admission the things that are most important for the nurse to address before leaving the client alone are the bedrest and fluid restriction orders, signs and symptoms to call the nurse for (in this case seizures or changes in LOC) and diagnostic test that are ordered so the client will not be surprised if another team member comes into the room. Medication teaching should be done when the medicine is given. Diet teaching will need to be done before lunch. Since the client is on bedrest discussions of strenuous activities can occur later. Discussions of monitoring urine output can occur when the child needs to void.


Case Study Question 6 of 6 
Six-year-old male with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is admitted to the pediatric unit.

The nurse evaluates the family’s understanding of the treatment plan. 
For each client statement, click to specify whether the statement indicates an understanding, or no understanding of teaching provided. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The child is experiencing poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. The child is at risk for seizures and encephalopathy.  The parent must understand the importance of close monitoring for changes in LOC or seizure activity and when to seek additional medical attention.

The parent brings a 6-year-old male child to the emergency department with new symptoms after completing treatment for strep throat.

Complete the diagram by dragging from the choices below to specify what condition the client is most likely experiencing, 2 actions the nurse should take to address that condition, and 2 parameters the nurse should monitor to assess the client’s progress.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The child is most likely experiencing poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) based on the history, reported urine characteristics, elevated blood pressure, periorbital edema, the elevated WBC, and the anti-streptolysin O titer. Serum albumin levels would be low with nephrotic syndrome. High fever, flank pain, and foul smelling urine would be expected with pyelonephritis. The creatine and BUN are not elevated enough to indicate acute renal failure. Treatment for PSGN includes treating the strep infection, giving diuretics, restricting fluids and if needed giving antihypertensives. Dialysis may be needed but that would not occur before trying other measures. The best indicators  of treatment effectiveness are improved urine output  and color and resolution of the hypertension.

The nurse is caring for a 74-year-old woman admitted to a rehabilitation unit following a right hip replacement two days ago.

Drag the 4 findings that need immediate follow-up to the box on the right.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Vital signs, with exception of temperature heart rate, are similar to baseline. Heart rate, while elevated, is still within normal parameters and may be the result of the fever. Confusion, fever, cloudy urine, and lower back pain are new symptoms.

The nurse is caring for a 74-year-old woman admitted to a rehabilitation unit following a right hip replacement two days ago.

Which problem(s) could the client be experiencing? Select all that apply.

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: The client is experiencing acute confusion which had an abrupt onset (delirium) as opposed to chronic confusion (dementia). Confusion, along with fever, chills, and lower back pain are all signs of a UTI. There is no data to support the client being constipated or having an incisional infection. Renal calculi typically present with severe, sharp back and side pain.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The signs and symptoms the client is experiencing, including delirium, suggest UTI. There is no indication that the client is constipated, has renal calculi, or has an incisional infection.


Case Study Question 4 of 6 
The nurse is caring for a 74-year-old woman admitted to a rehabilitation unit following a right hip replacement two days ago.

Select the orders from each of the categories the nurse anticipates including in the plan of care. Each category may have more than one order.

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: A UTI is suspected. Since the client has an indwelling catheter, a culture should be sent, the catheter discontinued, and clindamycin started to treat the infection. It is important to monitor intake and output once the catheter is discontinued since the client previously experienced urinary retention. The client should not be restrained without trying other interventions first. A stool softener, antidepressant, and dementia medication are not indicated.


Case Study Question 5 of 6 
The nurse is caring for a 74-year-old woman admitted to a rehabilitation unit following a right hip replacement two days ago.

The client’s cognition has improved the next day  after starting antibiotics.
What should the nurse teach the client about the treatment plan? Select all that apply.
The entire course of clindamycin should be taken, even if symptoms resolve*
Further evaluation to rule out dementia will be needed
Removing the catheter will help restore body’s normal flushing out of bacteria*
Urinary output will be closely monitored for the first 8 hours after catheter removal*
If the urge to urinate is felt, try to hold off voiding to fill the bladder with more urine
Minimizing activity helps allow the body to fight the infection
The likelihood of developing a UTI in the future is decreased
The culture and sensitivity will identify the correct antibiotic to be prescribed for the infection*
Increase fluid intake to up to 3 liters per day if possible*
Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: The client likely has CAUTI. Sending a C&S will determine 1) if there is an infection and 2) if the appropriate antibiotic is prescribed. Removing the catheter eliminates the mode of transmission and helps to restore the body’s natural flushing out of bacteria. Increased fluid intake will also help to flush out the bacteria. The full course of antibiotics should be taken even if symptoms resolve. The nurse should monitor the client’s voiding pattern to identify potential urinary retention. Evaluation for dementia is not necessary as the client likely had delirium because of the UTI. The client should void when the urge is felt as bacteria can multiply when holding urine.

The nurse is caring for a 74-year-old woman admitted to a rehabilitation unit following a right hip replacement two days ago.

For each client statement, click to specify whether the statement indicates an understanding, or no understanding of teaching provided. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The client should drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day to flush bacteria out of the urinary system. Cotton enhances ventilation of the perineal area and helps prevent accumulation of perineal moisture with facilitates bacterial growth. The bacteria present in bath water can readily enter the urethra. The full course of clindamycin should be finished even if symptoms resolve. The client should practice frequent voiding to flush bacteria out of the urethra and prevent organisms from ascending into the bladder. The use of harsh soaps, bubble bath, powder, or sprays in the perineal areas should be avoided. These substances can be irritating to the urethra and encourage inflammation and bacterial infection. Burning with urination is not normal. It may indicate recurrence of UTI.


Trend
The nurse is caring for a 74-year-old woman admitted to a rehabilitation unit following a right hip replacement two days ago.

The nurse reassesses the client the next morning. 
For each possible finding, click to specify if the finding indicates that the client’s status has improved, declined, or is unchanged. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Client’s orientation and resolution of lower back pain are improvements in the client’s symptoms and indicate the UTI is being treated effectively. Cloudy urine Is an unchanged sign which indicates that the infection may still be present. Increasing temperature indicates that the infection has not been treated effectively and the client’s condition may be worsening.

The 52- year- old client presents to an outpatient clinic for severe pain 3 days post-op appendectomy.


Complete the diagram by dragging from the choices below to specify what condition the client is most likely experiencing, 2 actions the nurse should take to address that condition, and 2 parameters the nurse should monitor to assess the client’s progress.


Rationale: Nausea, tremors, severe lower back pain can be indicators of many conditions.  However, the combination of these symptoms, in conjunction with the client’s history of substance abuse disorder, and discontinuation of pain medication is indicative of opioid withdrawal.  A bowel obstruction would most likely include other abdominal symptoms. Client is afebrile and has a normal WBC, so infection is less likely to be of concern. The client is at risk for hepatotoxicity based on the acetaminophen dose and history of alcohol use, but the liver functions are only slightly elevated making hepatoxicity less likely. The client most needs a pain management consult to adjust medications and education about using OTC medications that may also include ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Surgery consult and wound cultures are not needed. Getting a urine toxicology screen is inappropriate for this client (Clinical Key, 2022). The nurse should monitor the client’s pain and pain medication use. Pain control does affect wound healing, but given the client’s history, this is not the main issue. Daily temperatures are not needed.  The liver functions are only borderline elevated and does not require weekly monitoring.

Case Study Question 1 of 6
A 35-year-old female with end stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis is admitted to the medical surgical unit unit with abdominal pain and fever.

Which 5 findings are the most concerning? 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Fever, abdominal pain, elevated WBC in the serum and dialysate effluent are indications of peritonitis, a potentially life-threatening complication of peritoneal dialysis. Although the BUN and creatinine are high for an individual without renal failure, these values are typical of a client with end stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. The blood pressure and heart rate are only slightly elevated, so are not a priority at this time. The respiratory rate is within normal range for an adult. Erythema and creamy, yellow exudate around the peritoneal dialysis catheter exit site indicate the possible presence of an exit site infection, which may be the source of the peritonitis.


Case Study Question 2 of 6
A 35-year-old female with end stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis is admitted to the medical surgical unit unit with abdominal pain and fever.

For each client finding, click to specify if the finding supports the diagnosis of peritonitis or end stage renal disease (ESRD). Each finding may support more than one condition. Each column must have at least 1 option selected.


Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale:  C-reactive protein is an inflammatory marker and is elevated in the presence of infection and inflammation. BUN, creatinine, and potassium imbalances are common in clients with ESRD associated with the inability of the client’s kidneys to excrete waste products. Anemia is indicated by the low hemoglobin and hematocrit. This is a result of the kidney’s inability to produce erythropoietin in client’s with ESRD. Elevated WBC and neutrophil levels are diagnostic of infection.


Case Study Question 3 of 6
A 35-year-old female with end stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis is admitted to the medical surgical unit unit with abdominal pain and fever.

The client is diagnosed with peritonitis.
Drag the most appropriate word from the choices to fill in the blank of the following sentence. 
The client is at highest risk for developing 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Approximately 11% of ESRD patients with peritonitis develop sepsis. Sepsis is a general term used to characterize an immune system response to an infection. In sepsis the chemicals from the body's own defenses trigger inflammatory responses, which can impair blood flow to organs, like the brain or heart. This in turn can lead to organ failure and tissue damage. At its most severe, the body's response to infection can cause dangerously low blood pressure, a sign of septic shock. The mortality from septic shock is about 33%. 


Case Study Question 4 of 6
A 35-year-old female with end stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis is admitted to the medical surgical unit unit with abdominal pain and fever.

The nurse reviews new lab information
Based on the new lab data, for each potential order, click to specify whether the order is appropriate or not appropriate to include in the plan of care.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale for “Not Appropriate”: IVF: D5 ½ NS with 20mEq/l KCl at 120 ml/hr is not appropriate as client’s with ESRD are oliguric or anuric and this would place the client at risk for developing hypervolemia and hyperkalemia. Vancomycin is not effective against gram-negative pathogens. Unless the patient is septic, antibiotics should be infused intraperitoneally for peritonitis in clients with ESRD on peritoneal dialysis. Enoxaparin is not appropriate in clients with ESRD. This medication is excreted renally, so clients with ESRD cannot clear the medication, leading to a high risk of bleeding.
Rationale for “Appropriate”: A daily weight is needed to assess for hypervolemia associated with ESRD. Inflammation of the peritoneum associated with peritonitis may interfere with the efficacy of peritoneal dialysis. Blood cultures are needed to assess for potential bacteremia. Clients with bacteremia may need IV antibiotics in addition to intra-peritoneal antibiotics. PD catheter care is needed to treat the infection. The catheter may need to be removed and reinserted if the infection does not clear. Gentamicin is a good broad-spectrum antibiotic that treats gram-negative bacteria. Once culture results are received, the antibiotic should be adjusted based on sensitivity results. Intra-peritoneal delivery is more effective than IV for peritonitis. Epoetin alfa is used to treat anemia associated with ESRD. In clients with ESRD, the kidneys do not produce enough erythropoietin to stimulate red blood cell production. Calcium carbonate, a phosphate binders must be taken with each meal to prevent the absorption of phosphorus from the gut. Keeping serum phosphate levels within the normal range will prevent serum phosphorus from binding with serum calcium, which lowers the calcium level. 


Case Study Question 5 of 6 
A 35-year-old female with end stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis is admitted to the medical surgical unit unit with abdominal pain and fever.

For each task click to specify if the task should be performed by the RN, the LPN, or the UAP. 


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The UAP provides basic care skills such as hygiene, and collects limited assessment data, such as vital signs and weights. The LPN can perform nursing care in “routine” nursing situations. They can provide non-complicated wound care. They cannot implement “non-routine” care such as administering antibiotics intraperitoneally, providing catheter care teaching or performing a dialysate exchange for a client on peritoneal dialysis. Those tasks must be done by the RN.


Case Study Question 6 of 6 
A 35-year-old female with end stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis is admitted to the medical surgical unit unit with abdominal pain and fever.

The nurse teaches the client about peritoneal dialysis catheter care to help prevent future infections.
Click to specify whether each statement indicates the client understands or does not understand the teaching provided concerning self-care of the peritoneal dialysis catheter. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Clients should not pick or remove crusts or scabs at the exit site before washing the site. This could tear the skin and increase the risk for site infection. Clients should clean the catheter exit site with a liquid antibacterial soap and a clean cloth. Antiseptics can dry and crack the skin, increasing the risk of infection. The exit site should not be left open to air. It should be covered with sterile gauze, which should be changed every time the site is cleaned.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The client has evidence of a skin infection at the AV site. The drop in blood pressure and pulse oximeter readings suggest the client has septicemia and is developing septic shock. Antibiotics and oxygen are most needed. The nurse should monitor the client’s perfusion by watching for changes in the pulse oximeter and blood pressure.  Urine output is not a good measure of perfusion in a client on dialysis.

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale:  Pulmonary contusions, cardiac tamponade, and a pneumothorax  all may result after severe chest trauma and may present as labored breathing and chest pain. All can cause tachycardia and hypotension but by different mechanisms. Pulmonary contusions are associated with frank bleeding that can lead to shock. A pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade are associated with decreased cardiac output.  Respiratory acidosis can be seen with pulmonary contusions and pneumothorax but not a cardiac tamponade Asymmetrical chest movement, absent breath sounds, and tracheal deviation are symptoms of a pneumothorax.

Assist with thoracentesis*
Administer pain medication*
Insert foley 
Obtain a stat chest X-ray*
Set up a chest drainage system*
Transfuse  a unit of blood

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: The client is most likely experiencing a tension pneumothorax. The nurse must prepare for immediate thoracentesis to relieve chest pressure. Treatment then will include inserting a chest tube and connecting it to low intermittent suction via a chest drainage system to re-inflate the lung.  ChestXray is done before chest tube placement if time allows. If not it is obtained soon after. The nurse should administer pain medication before the provider performs the thoracentesis and inserts the chest tube. Decisions on whether the client needs blood will be made if the client still has shock or evidence of internal bleeding after the pneumothorax is evacuated. There is no need to insert a foley catheter

The client is diagnosed with a pneumothorax and the provider places a chest tube. 

For each nursing action, click to specify if the action is indicated/ not indicated. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The nurse should administer pain medications to manage the client’s pain before and after the insertion of the chest tube and as needed after.  If the chest tube is connected to a water seal drainage, the system should be kept below the level of the insertion to promote drainage. The nurse should monitor the water seal for fluctuations which indicate the system is functioning properly. Any drainage should be recorded as output. A chest X-ray in the morning will document progressive inflation of the lung. The client is stuporous and should not ambulate. An occlusive dressing is applied to the chest tube insertion site to prevent air from leaking around the tube. This dressing should not be manipulated to avoid the possibility of air entering the chest cavity.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The vital signs indicate the client is improving. The nurse should continue monitoring the client, including assessing the lung sounds for improvement in airflow in the damaged lung.  A blood gas may not be needed if the client shows enough improvement. There is no need to cahck for air leaks in the system appears to be functioning.

Complete the diagram below by dragging the choices provided to specify what condition the client is most likely experiencing, and two actions the nurse should take to address the condition, and parameters the nurse should monitor to assess the client’s progress. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The vital signs, absent breath sounds, and tracheal deviations indicate the client is developing a tension pneumothorax. The nurse should call the rapid response team to administer emergency treatment to the client, such as inserting a chest tube.  A stat chest Xray can help confirm the diagnosis. Improved respiratory status and improved hemodynamic status(blood pressure/pulse) are the best indicators the tension pneumo thorax is resolved. Pain may stay elevated because of rib fractures. Blood gases are obtained as needed. If the respiratory improves another blood gas may not be needed after treatment.

The nurse conducts a home visit on 68-year-old male client with Parkinson’s disease following a recent fall 3 days after discharge from an acute care setting. 

Drag the 3 findings that need immediate follow-up to the box on the right.



Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Dizziness is symptom related to orthostatic hypotension and can be a side effect of lisinopril. This puts the client at increased risk for falls. Sleep disturbance is not a normal part of aging and needs additional assessment, as fatigue can increase fall risk. The diminished strength in the client’s legs also increases his risk for falls.

Case Study Question 2 of 6 
The nurse conducts a home visit on 68-year-old male client with Parkinson’s disease following a recent fall 3 days after discharge from an acute care setting. 

For each finding, click to specify if the finding is a risk factor or not a risk factor when conducting a fall risk assessment.


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Medications causing orthostatic hypotension may increase the risk for falls, need for frequent toileting increases need for mobility and use of stairs, history of a fall is a known risk factor for additional falls; advanced age, > 80, is considered a fall risk.



Case Study Question 3 of 6 
The nurse conducts a home visit on 68-year-old male client with Parkinson’s disease following a recent fall 3 days after discharge from an acute care setting. 

The nurse completes the environmental assessment. 
What does the nurse determine is the care priority for this client?
Adjust medications
Teach client about orthostatic hypotension
Modify access to toilet facilities*
Obtain rugs to cover wood floor areas


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Modifying access to toilet facilities will address the client’s only need to use the stairs, and reduce his risk for falls. This is an intervention that will increase client’s quality of life and have limited associated expense.
 


Case Study Question 4 of 6 
The nurse conducts a home visit on 68-year-old male client with Parkinson’s disease following a recent fall 3 days after discharge from an acute care setting. 

The nurse develops a plan of care to prevent fall and maximize the client’s quality of life.
For each potential intervention, click to specify whether the intervention is appropriate  or not appropriate  to include in the plan of care.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The client is not ready for extended care facility placement. Flexibility exercises, such as yoga or tai chi, will help promote range-of-motions and balance. Home physical therapy will help maintain strength and flexibility. A bedside commode will enable the client to use the toilet without climbing stairs. Exploring activities of interest and allowing the client time to respond to questions will help keep client engaged and prevent social isolation.
A fluid restriction is not indicated, based on signs of dehydration. Promoting as much independence as possible in self-care is important to client self-esteem. Due to client’s decreased strength and orthostatic hypotension, he should be encouraged to use the walker when ambulating.

Case Study Question 5 of 6 
The nurse conducts a home visit on 68-year-old male client with Parkinson’s disease following a recent fall 3 days after discharge from an acute care setting. 

The nurse provides education for on-going care to the client and son. 
Specify whether action should or should not be included in the teaching plan. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Clients with Parkinson’s disease should be encouraged to participate in self-care for as long as possible. This helps with both motor skills and self-esteem. Lisinopril can cause orthostatic hypotension, so instruction on standing up slowly is important. Wearing socks on the wood floor increases the risk for falls. Instead, the client should always wear shoes. Making the toilet more accessible is a healthier option to decreasing fluid because dehydration can contribute to the risk for falls. Weightlifting is not considered a safe activity for clients with decreased strength.   Focus on flexibility and stretching is more beneficial that strength training in Parkinson’s disease. Using the bedside commode is a safety intervention to prevent the use of stairs when unattended. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive degenerative disease that will not be cured by medication. Carbidopa/levodopa can help with symptoms of shakiness and trouble moving, but will not prevent disease progression.
Case Study Question 6 of 6 
The nurse conducts a return home visit 3 months later on 68-year-old male client with Parkinson’s disease and a history of falls. 

The nurse returns in 3 months to re-evaluate the client. 
For each finding, click to specify if the finding indicates that the client’s status has improved, declined, or is unchanged. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Changes in cognition such as confusion and irritability and declining speech capability are signs of progressing disease. No fall shows in 3 months shows interventions have been effective. Joining a support group  and an online yoga class demonstrate an understanding of disease progression and positive interventions. The client was using a walker and had dizziness upon standing at the initial visit.

Complete the diagram by dragging from the choices below to specify what priority condition the client is most likely to experience, 2 actions the nurse should take to address that condition, and 2 parameters the nurse should monitor to assess the client’s progress.



Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Safety is a priority concern for clients with Parkinson disease. The client’s greatest fall risk is going upstairs to use the toilet. Access could be modified with a commode. Flexibility training will decrease risk of falls. Changing medications and extended care placement are not yet indicated. A speech referral will not. Continuous monitoring of coordination, balance, strength and range of motion will alert the nurse to changes needed in the care environment and the disease progresses.

Case Study Question 1 of 6 
The nurse is caring for a client at 26 weeks gestation in the out-patient clinic.  



Which 3 clinical findings are most concerning?
Previous vaginal deliveries
Blood pressure
History of large birthweight babies*
Maternal age*
Blood pressure
Gestation
BMI*

Scoring Rule: 0/1

Rationale:  Any individual giving birth over the age of 40, with a BMI > 30 kg/m², and sedentary lifestyle is at risk for gestational diabetes.  Other risk factors include: first degree family relative with diabetes, history of polycystic ovarian disease, previous pregnancies with gestational diabetes or large birthweight babies. (ACOG, 2018) Approximately 2-10% of all pregnancies are affected by gestational diabetes (CDC, 2022)



Case Study Question 2 of 6 
The nurse is caring for a client at 26 weeks gestation in the out-patient clinic.  


Which of the following clinical findings puts the client at risk for gestational diabetes? (Select all that apply)
Fetal heart rate
Multigravida status
Pre-pregnancy BMI 32 kg/m² **
Level of physical activity based on occupation**
Weight gain 2 pounds since last visit
Previous children birthweight more than 9 lb(4kg)**
Maternal age**

Scoring Rule: +/-

Rationale:  Any individual giving birth over the age of 40, with a BMI > 30 kg/m², and sedentary lifestyle is at risk for gestational diabetes.  Other risk factors include family history of diabetes, history of polycystic ovarian disease, previous pregnancies with gestational diabetes or large birthweight babies. (ACOG, 2018). The weight gain of up to a pound a week would be a typical finding. Slower weight gain is advised for clients that are obese at the beginning of pregnancy.  


Case Study Question 3 of 6 
The nurse is caring for a client at 26 weeks gestation in the out-patient clinic.  


The 26 week laboratory report returns. 

Complete the following sentence by choosing from the list of options.




Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale:   A glucose tolerance test (GTT) is done to screen for gestational diabetes. Stabilizing the blood glucose is the priority since it is abnormal and consistent glucose levels within the target range promote the best fetal and maternal outcomes (ACOG, 2018). Slowing weight gain is desirable but cutting calories can lead to ketoacidosis.  Macrosomia (large baby) is best prevented by stabilizing blood glucose levels.  The client will have to come back for a 3 hour Glucose Tolerance Test(GTT) since the client failed the 1 hour GTT.  The 1 hour GTT is for screening, whereas the 3 hour GTT is diagnostic for this client.  (ACOG, 2018)




Case Study Question 4 of 6 
The nurse is caring for a client at 26 weeks gestation in the out-patient clinic.  


The client takes the 3 hour glucose tolerance test and receives the diagnosis of gestational diabetes. The nurse begins to develop the plan of care.

What additional assessment data should the nurse obtain? Select All that Apply
Access to transportation
24 hour diet recall**
Assessment of salt intake
Economic ability to purchase healthy food**
Access to supermarkets**
Location of kitchen in residence
Assess intake of foods containing vitamin K
Physical activity patterns**

Scoring Rule: +/-

Rationale: Lifestyle changes, like diet and exercise, are successful in 70-85% of all individuals diagnosed with gestational diabetes. (Johns, et al , 2018). Knowledge of glycemic index and complex carbohydrates is important for revising diet for a person with gestational diabetes.  Additionally, social determinants of health are imperative to examine in this client related to their diet, physical activity and issues that pertain (CDC, 2022). Although transportation is necessary to participate in prenatal visits, it is not a major concern.  Additionally, kitchen location and vitamin K rich foods are also not the highest concern for a nurse to assess.




Case Study Question 5 of 6 

The nurse is caring for a client at 26 weeks gestation in the out-patient clinic.  


The nurse implements a dietary plan to manage the client’s diabetes during pregnancy. 

Which 3 elements should nurse most include in the dietary teaching plan?

Encourage use of low fiber food
Identify carbohydrates with low glycemic index**
Client should increase fat based foods while pregnant   
Recommend consultation with a registered dietician**
Should consume 2 large meals and 3 small snacks/day
Should consume 3 small – moderate meals and 4 snacks/day**
Discuss the importance of consuming high sodium diet

Scoring Rule: 0/1

Rationale:  Lifestyle changes will be the first step in intervening with a client with gestational diabetes. The correct diet plan is key.  A dietician consultation would provide the best guidance in promoting a client – centric diet. Carbohydrates should not exceed 40% of calories, protein should be approximately 20% of calories (ADA, 2021). Ideally, the pregnant individual should plan 3 small- moderate meals with 4 snacks.  Other things that should be included in the educational plan is how to perform finger sticks for blood glucose monitoring and when to report results to your nurse midwife or practitioner.  Controlling glucose levels can also be achieved via fostering exercise.  This plan should be coordinated with the provider or nurse midwife.



Case Study Question 6 of 6 

The client diagnosed with gestational diabetes returns to the clinic in 4 weeks.


The client returns in 1 month for a follow-up appointment and repeat labs. 
What conclusions does the nurse make about the treatment plan?  Select all that apply
Fetal growth pattern is appropriate.**
Serum glucose is appropriate for gestational age.***
The weight gain is needs further assessment.
Dietary and exercise regimen seems to be working.**
The client will not need biophysical fetal monitoring added to the plan of care.
Elevated glucose levels indicates that the client needs oral hypoglycemic agents.  

Scoring Rule: +/-

Rationale: The patient and fetal findings indicate well controlled gestational diabetes.  Dietary and exercise regimen seems to be working. The weight gain and blood glucose are appropriate. The client will still need biophysical monitoring to ensure fetal well-being.
 


Trend 

The nurse cares for a 44-year-old pregnant female client diagnosed with gestational diabetes at 26 weeks gestation in the outpatient clinic.


The nurse reassesses the client’s labs 4 weeks later after implementing lifestyle changes.

Which of the following factors would indicate that the patient is improving? Select All that Apply

Serum glucose**
Urine glucose**
Urine ketones
Urine protein
WBC count
Serum creatinine

Scoring Rule: +/-

Rationale: The client had elevated serum  glucose  presence of glucose in urine at 26 weeks gestation.  All other factors were normal. The serum glucose is now acceptable and there is no glucose in the urine.

Case Study Question 1 of 6 
A 74-year-old female is admitted to the Emergency Room with increasing dyspnea, productive cough, and fatigue.

The nurse reviews the client’s initial assessment.  
Which priority findings require immediate follow-up. Select all that apply. 

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: An impairment in gas exchange, as evidenced by the client exhibiting tachypnea, accessory muscle use, coarse crackles and green-tinged sputum are all priority findings. The client is afebrile with a temp of 99.0 F (37.2C).  Digital clubbing is a common finding in client’s with a history of COPD, and the client’s smoking history along with medication non-compliance are less acute and non-urgent findings that do not require priority nursing intervention. 



Case Study Question 2 of 6 
A 74-year-old female is admitted to the Emergency Room with increasing dyspnea, productive cough, and fatigue.

For each client finding, click to indicate if the finding is consistent with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, or pulmonary embolism. Each finding may support more than one type of respiratory condition.
Note: Each column must have at least 1 finding.
Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Clinical manifestations of COPD include dyspnea, cough, increased A/P diameter (barrel chest), digital clubbing, and expiratory wheezing. Both an increased A/P diameter and digital clubbing are not clinical manifestations of pneumonia, or asthma, or pulmonary embolism. Wheezing is rare with pulmonary embolism and the cough is dry or blood tinged.


Case Study Question 3 of 6 
A 74-year old female is admitted to the Emergency Room with increasing dyspnea, productive cough, and fatigue.

 Which condition is the client most likely experiencing? 
Acute asthma attack
COPD exacerbation*
Pneumonia 
Pulmonary embolism 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The client has a known history of COPD –emphysema; they are hypoxic and using accessory muscles to breathe. The client also verbalizes worsening shortness of breath. Based on the client’s presenting signs, symptoms, and clinical manifestations, this client is most likely experiencing a COPD exacerbation. 






Case Study Question 4 of 6 
A 74-year old female is admitted to the Emergency room with increasing dyspnea, productive cough, and fatigue.

The nurse anticipates the provider’s orders and considers possible nursing interventions. 
Select the orders from each of the categories the nurse should include in the plan of care at this time. Each category may have more than one order.

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: The client is experiencing a COPD exacerbation. Placing the client in a high fowler’s position and encouraging the use of the incentive spirometer will assist in maximizing the client’s lung expansion and improving ventilatory efforts. Administering ipratropium bromide and albuterol and methylprednisolone can assist in alleviating airway narrowing and inflammation caused by the client’s exacerbated symptoms. Placing a client with a known history of COPD on high-flow oxygen can induce carbon dioxide narcosis. Administering ondansetron is not indicated unless in this case since the client does not have nausea and/or vomiting.
Case Study Question 5 of 6 
A 74-year old female is admitted to the Emergency room with increasing dyspnea, productive cough, and fatigue.

The ipratropium bromide albuterol treatment is given. 
Which medication should the nurse give next?

Acetaminophen
Methylprednisolone sodium*
Albuterol 
Amoxicillin/clavulanate

Scoring Rule: 0/1


Rationale: IV methylprednisolone is ordered now and will help reduce inflammation to improve ease of breathing. The antibiotic should be given after the neb treatment.  Albuterol was just givenfor Q4 you can make , the client would need to be reassessed to determine if another dose is needed. The client is verbalizing 0 out of 10 pain,  so acetaminophen is not necessary at this time. 


Case Study Question 6 of 6 
A 74-year old female is admitted to the Emergency room with increasing dyspnea, productive cough, and fatigue.

The nurse administers the ordered medications and reassesses the client at 1045. 
For each client finding, click to specify if the finding indicates that the client’s status has improved, declined, or is unchanged. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The client’s respiratory rate, breath sounds, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure have all declined despite the nurse administering  ordered medications.  The client is no longer exhibiting expiratory wheezing upon auscultation. The client’s temperature remains unchanged. The nurse should promptly alert the provider as the client’s respiratory symptoms are rapidly deteriorating.

An 8-year-old girl at school is taken from the lunchroom to the nursing office with respiratory issues.

Which client findings could be consistent with a food allergy? Select all that apply.
Blood pressure
Facial swelling*
Heart rate
Itching*
Respiratory status*
Temperature

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Temperature changes are never a result of a food allergy. Respiratory status, itching, facial swelling, blood pressure and heart rate can be indicative of a reaction. However, blood pressure and heart rate are still within the normal limits for the child’s age.


Case Study Question 3 of 6 
An 8-year-old girl at school is taken from the lunchroom to the nursing office with respiratory issues.

Which condition is the client most likely experiencing? 
Anaphylaxis*
Croup
Status asthmaticus
Airway obstruction

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Child has a known food allergy. Asthma could account for increased work of breathing but typically wheezing is common not stridor. Airway obstruction could be a consideration due to eating lunch and potentially choking. Croup can account for the respiratory issues the child exhibits but fails to explain the hives and itching.

For each potential intervention, click to specify whether the intervention is appropriate or not appropriate to include in the plan of care.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Child is not hyperventilating, so loss of CO2 is not a concern requiring breathing into a bag. Albuterol can be used to relieve breathing symptoms. Heimlich maneuver is not indicated as child does not have food lodged in throat. Inducing vomiting is not indicated for situation. Injectable epinephrine should be given, and parents should be notified.

Student was reassessed by nurse 20 minutes after epinephrine injection.
For each finding, click to specify if the finding indicates that the client’s status has improved, declined, or is unchanged. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Reassessment indicates improvement in areas of respiratory status, facial swelling, and itching which is expected with the use of epinephrine. No changes with blood pressure and temperature. Heart rate has increased, and child is reporting symptoms of lightheadedness which both could be a result of the epinephrine.

Case Study Question 1 of 6 
 A 23-year-old male with bipolar disorder has a health maintenance appointment with the telehealth nurse. 


Drag the 4 clinical findings that need follow-up to the box on the right.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale:  Tongue thrusting is an extrapyramidal adverse effect caused by risperidone (Burcham & Rosenthal, 2022).  This is an adverse effect of the second-generation antipsychotic risperidone.   Other metabolic adverse effects include weight gain, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia (Burcham & Rosenthal, 2022).  Other concerning issues include the patient’s inability to sleep.  Sleep disturbance is a core symptom of bipolar disorder (Roloff et al , 2022). A fine hand tremor is concerning since the client is on lithium, but it is a common side effect and not a top priority.


Case Study Question 2 of 6 
A 23-year-old male with bipolar disorder has a health maintenance appointment with the telehealth nurse.




Which clinical finding is most concerning?

Cholesterol level
Weight gain 
Difficulty sleeping
Tongue thrusting**

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Some factors require immediate attention – such as tongue thrusting – since it is an adverse effect of risperidone.  This is an extra pyramidal symptom (EPS).  If this symptom is not reported early and managed, it can be irreversible (Burcham & Rosenthal, 2022).  Other factors, like metabolic adverse effects of risperidone (HgbA1C, weight gain) may occur and should be evaluated, but do not require immediate attention (Burcham & Rosenthal, 2022).  Fatigue or difficulty sleeping should be monitored since this could be an indication of depression.  


Case Study Question 3 of 6 
A 23-year-old male with bipolar disorder has a health maintenance appointment with the telehealth nurse.



Drag 1 condition and 1 cause to fill in the blanks of the following sentence. 
 
The nurse should recognize that the client is most likely experiencing						caused by 

Scoring Rule: Rationale
Rationale:  Tongue thrusting is an extrapyramidal symptom, which can be caused by antipsychotic medications, that can be irreversible if not identified early in therapy. (Burchum & Rosenthal, 2022).  Other EPS symptoms include akathisia, acute dystonia and pseudo-Parkinsonism.  



Case Study Question 4 of 6 
A 23-year-old male with bipolar disorder has a health maintenance appointment with the telehealth nurse.

The nurse concludes the client is most likely experiencing tardive dyskinesia. 
Which 2  interventions should the nurse anticipate to including in the plan of care? 
 
Discontinue risperidone**
Decrease lithium dose
Obtain more frequent lithium levels
Order for a low salt diet 
Monitor for other extrapyramidal symptoms**

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale:  Due to the serious adverse effects of risperidone, the nurse should expect that the drug be discontinued.  This client requires maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder and monotherapy with lithium, a mood stabilizer, is usually sufficient. If the patient experiences a manic episode, a different antipsychotic, besides risperidone, might be prescribed ( Micromedex, 2022). The nurse should monitor for other adverse effects (Burchum & Rosenthal, 2022)




Case Study Question 5 of 6 
A 23-year-old male with bipolar disorder has a health maintenance appointment with the telehealth nurse.

The prescriber discontinues the risperidone, and the nurse teaches the client about the treatment plan. 
For each possible action, click to specify if the following client education is indicated or not indicated.


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The client has to be monitored for the frequency of tardive dyskinesia (uncontrolled orofacial movements) to see if the tardive dyskinesia is subsiding.  The nurse should also teach the client and family to monitor for bipolar symptoms (e.g., depressive symptoms and or suicidality or symptoms of mania).  Since the client will be maintained on lithium, which has a very narrow therapeutic index,  the client and family must monitor for adverse effects indicative of toxicity.  Hydration status is key to maintaining a stable lithium concentration and changes in sodium or hydration status can lead to therapeutic excess or failure (Burcham & Rosenthal, 2022).


Case Study Question 6 of 6 
A 23-year-old male with bipolar disorder has follow-up health maintenance appointment 2 months later.

The nurse evaluates the effectiveness of the treatment plan. 
For each finding, click to specify if the finding indicates that the client’s status has improved, declined, or is unchanged. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale:  In reviewing the client’s status, the patient appears to be improving in some manner (no more tardive dyskinesia) but his appearance and stopping school may indicate that his mental status may have declined.  The nurse should evaluate the client to determine if the findings indicate depression.

Complete the diagram by dragging from the choices below to specify what condition the client is most likely experiencing, 2 actions the nurse should take to address that condition, and 2 parameters the nurse should monitor to assess the client’s progress.


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Tardive dyskinesia (tongue thrusting) is the most concerning issue here.  It is an adverse effect of risperidone.  This is an extra pyramidal symptom (EPS).  If this symptom is not reported early and managed, it can be irreversible (Burcham & Rosenthal, 2022).  Some patients may be on an antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer like lithium.  Decreasing lithium will not affect the EPS, and offering a sedative will mask the symptom.  Monitoring salt intake is always necessary when a patient is on lithium.  The other conditions are also EPS.  In monitoring this patient for tardive dyskinesia, the nurse will continue to monitor for other EPS and depressive and or manic symptoms expressed by the client (since the medications will need to be adjusted).

Case Study Question 1 of 6 
A 9-year-old male with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is seen in the clinic for medication management.

Which 4 findings require follow-up? 
Behavior management
Medication administration*
School performance
Appetite*
Sleep*
Pulse 
Blood pressure
Weight*

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Client reports the medication side effects of decreased appetite and sleep. Reporting that medication is given first thing in the morning may mean that the medication is being given before the child has a chance to eat. The 5 pound weight loss in 3 months is significant. Reported school performance (grades) and use of behavioral management strategies are positive findings. Blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits for age.    

Case Study Question 2 of 6 
A  9-year-old male with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is seen in the clinic for medication management.

What 3 problems should the nurses address at this visit? 
Inappropriate behavior management
Medication management*
Optimizing school performance
Nutrition counseling*
Sleep patterns*
Hypertension prevention

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The client has weight loss and sleep issues most likely related to the ADHD medications.  The client needs medication teaching because they are taking the medication before they eat breakfast.  The nurse does not need to address behavior management strategies because they are appropriate or optimizing school performance that is improving. The child’s B/P is normal.

Case Study Question 3 of 6 
A 9-year-old male with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is seen in the clinic for medication management.

Which condition is the client most likely experiencing? 
Adverse drug reaction
Side effects of medication*
Noncompliance with medication use
Drug dependency

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale:  Side effects are predictable unintended responses to medications. For stimulants used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorders side effects include decreased appetite, rapid weight loss and insomnia. Side effects can often be managed without discontinuing treatment. Adverse reactions are less predictable, more severe, and more likely to require discontinuing treatment. The client is having a therapeutic effect (improved behavior/school performance) on the target dose thus it is unlikely the effects are due to non- compliance. There is no evidence of drug dependency.

Case Study Question 4 of 6 
9-year-old male with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is seen in the clinic for medication management.

For each potential intervention click to specify if it is indicated or not indicated to include in the plan of care
  
Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Important interventions for the nurse include obtaining a detailed diet history, accurately plotting height and weight on their growth chart health record, reviewing sleep habits, including the child in discussion of food choices and options for treatment.  An EKG is not indicated at this time as the child does not have any respiratory or cardiac complaints and vital signs are normal. Monitoring weight over time is the preferred strategy in children. Weekly or monthly weights are sufficient. The client is showing improved ADHD symptoms on the medication. Attempts should be made to manage the symptoms before deciding if the medication needs to be discontinued.


Case Study Question 5 of 6 
9-year-old male with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is seen in the clinic for medication management.

The nurse provides dietary and sleep management counseling.
What should the nurse teach the client about the treatment plan?  Select all that apply.
Medications should be given after breakfast*
Keep a strict schedule for meals and snacks
Offer high-calorie, nutrient-dense food choices.*
Develop a consistent bed-time routine*
Consider adding nutritional supplements*
Avoid eating before bedtime
Remove electronics from the bedroom*
Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Stimulant medication should be administered in the morning immediately after a healthy breakfast. Dietary modifications should focus on nutrient dense, high calorie foods and can include nutritional supplements. Establishing a bed-time routine will help with sleep. This includes removing electronics from the bedroom. Children who have appetite decreases while taking ADHD medication should be encouraged to eat when they feel hungry, possibly having a second dinner before bedtime.
Case Study Question 6 of 6 
9-year-old male with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is seen in the clinic for medication management.

The client returns to the clinic a month later.  
For each finding click to indicate if the finding shows the treatment plan has been effective or ineffective.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Giving the medication after breakfast and offering protein shakes show the teaching was effective. Gaining a pound in one month show the dietary modifications are working. Children between the ages of 8 and 10 need 10 to 12 hours of sleep a night. The nurse should focus on understanding the child’s sleep.

Rationale:  The nurse will need to follow up on findings that indicate the client may be having respiratory distress  or shock; increased respirations, drop in blood pressure, tachycardia, and decreased urinary output.  The pulse oximeter is low, but not critical. A client with burns will have pitting edema as a result of fluid shifting but it would not be a priority finding over any airway issues.  Clients with burns will have thermoregulation and pain issues but again, the airway and blood pressure need to be addressed quickly.  

Case Study Question 2 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 55-year-old female admitted to the burn unit following a house fire.  

For each client finding  click to specify whether the finding is consistent with compartment syndrome, inhalation injury, or distributive shock. Each assessment may support more than one condition.   
Note: Each column must have at least one finding. 
Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale:   If the client is progressing into shock from their injuries, they will have low blood pressure, and an elevated heart rate and respirations.  They may also experience edema as fluid shifts which can lead to peripheral edema.  Since the fluid is shifting, they become hypovolemic and the urinary output declines. Clients with compartment syndrome have pain and peripheral edema.  Clients with burns can experience airway obstruction and tachypnea at any point after the event due to smoke or inhalation injuries. This manifests as tachypnea, dyspnea, or changes in breaths sounds.

Case Study Question 3 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 55-year-old female admitted to the burn unit following a house fire.  

Complete the sentence from the list of drop-down options. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale:  Clients with major burns can go into shock due to massive fluid shifting.  Signs of distributive shock will include increased heart rate and respirations  and decreased blood pressure. While the respiratory rate is increasing, the pulse oximeter is not decreasing on low levels of oxygen. Edema is seen with  compartment syndrome, but pain is typically severe and there would be other neurovascular findings. 


Case Study Question 4 of 6 
The nurse cares for a  55- year-old female admitted to the burn unit following a house fire.  

The nurse contacts the physician about the client’s status. What orders does the nurse anticipate including in the plan of care?  

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale:  While aggressive fluid resuscitation is needed, it must be done judiciously to prevent fluid overload and pulmonary complications.  A chest-Xray and blood gas should be obtained to assess pulmonary status.  IV rates are typically increased no more than 20% per hour to prevent fluid overload. Monitoring metabolic panel helps assess fluid and electrolyte imbalances.  It is too soon to suspect a wound infection. 
Case Study Question 5 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 55-year-old female admitted to the burn unit following a house fire.     

The physician assesses the client and the nurse receives orders. 
What action should the nurse take first?
Obtain a chest Xray
Obtain an ABG
Increase the IV rate* 
Give albumin
Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale:  The most critical intervention is to increase the IVF. The chest Xray and blood gas can be done after the fluids are increased. The  vital signs do not yet indicate albumin is needed. 

Case Study Question 6 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 55-year-old female admitted to the burn unit following a house fire.  




The nurse reassesses the client at 2300.  
For each finding, click to indicate if the finding indicates the client’s condition has improved, declined, or is unchanged.  


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale:  The client’s hemodynamic status is stabilizing with fairly consistent heart and blood pressure measurements. The temperature also has remained fairly stable.  Urine output of 50 mL an hour is a sign of improved renal perfusion. Stridor and decreased pulse oximeter readings suggest the development of upper airway edema.

Case Study Question 1 of 6 
The nurse on the medical-surgical unit is caring for a 69-year-old male client with pain and swelling of the right lower extremity. 

Which 4 findings are most concerning? 
2+ pedal edema*
Pain 8/10 in right calf*
Warmth noted to right calf*
Positive motion R lower extremity
Right pedal pulse weak*
Right lower extremity elevated
Blood Pressure 145/82
HR 96
Positive sensation R lower extremity

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The nurse should recognize the following as signs of a possible deep vein thrombosis: pedal edema, calf pain, warmth to right calf, and a weak pedal pulse. Positive motion and sensation are expected, and not concerning. Blood pressure and heart rate are borderline, which is likely related to the pain rate and not a primary concern. The right lower extremity and bedrest orders must be followed but are not overall concerning about the client’s health condition.


Case Study Question 2 of 6 
The nurse on the medical-surgical unit is caring for a 69-year-old male client with pain and swelling of the right lower extremity. 

For each potential assessment finding, click to indicate if the finding is consistent with a deep vein thrombosis, a soft tissue injury, or an infection. Each finding may be consistent with  more than one conditions
Note: Each column must have at least 1 response option selected. 

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale:  Edema and pain are consistent all three problems.  Warmth to the calf may be seen with infection and DVT. A decreased pedal pulse most suggest DVT. Limited range of motion are consistent with soft tissue injury, but not DVT.

Case Study Question 3 of 6 
The nurse on the medical-surgical unit is caring for a 69-year-old male client with pain and swelling of the right lower extremity. 

Drag the most appropriate word from the choices to fill in the blank of the following sentence. 
The nurse should recognize that the client is most likely experiencing

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale:  The most likely cause of the client’s symptoms are right leg deep vein thrombosis(DVT). While some symptoms are consistent with other potential causes such as a sprain or infection the only diagnosis consistent with all of the client’s symptoms is DVT.


Case Study Question 4 of 6 
The nurse on the medical-surgical unit is caring for a 69-year-old male client with pain and swelling of the right lower extremity.  

Nurses’ notes have been updated with most recent radiology results.
For each potential intervention, click to specify whether the intervention is indicated or not indicated to include in the plan of care.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The nurse should anticipate anticoagulation therapy which may include an initial bolus dose of heparin followed by a continuous infusion. The heparin will require baseline PTT and consistent monitoring of the PTT every 6 hours per protocol. Compression stockings and elevating the right lower extremity are indicated. Ambulation is contraindicated until anticoagulation has begun due to the risk of mobilizing the venous thromboembolism.  Massage is also contraindicated because of risk of mobilizing the thrombus.


Case Study Question 5 of 6 
The nurse on the medical-surgical unit is caring for a 69-year-old male client with pain and swelling of the right lower extremity.  

The nurse reviews the physician’s orders.
For each order, click to specify if the nurse should implement the order immediately, within the next hour, or before the end of the shift.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The nurse should have the Pt/PTT drawn immediately since it is a stat order and the heparin cannot be started until it is completed. Both the bolus dose and initial infusion of Heparin should begin within the hour to prevent further extension of the DVT. The re-draw of the PTT should occur 6 hours after the initial dose per orders. Strict bedrest should be implemented immediately to prevent mobilizing the clot. Compression stockings will likely need to be obtained from supply and can be placed before the end of the shift. The right leg should be elevated sooner rather than later, but is not a first priority. Monitoring for signs of bleeding is not indicated until the first dose of heparin is initiated but should begin concurrently with the administration of the bolus dose of heparin.


Case Study Question 6 of 6 
The nurse on the Medical-Surgical unit is caring for a 69-year-old male client with pain and swelling of the right lower extremity.  

The client is reassessed on the third day and discharge orders are received.
Which client statements indicate the teaching was understood? Select All That Apply.
“To relieve my stress, I should have a glass of wine before dinner.”
“I will eat more spinach and kale every day.”
“I will throw away my straight razor and buy an electric one.”*
“If I miss a dose of my medicine, I will contact my doctor.”*
“Controlling my blood pressure is not important.”
“When I travel, I will get out and walk every 3-4 hours.”
“I set an alarm, so I take my medicine the same time daily.”*
Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: The client should maintain a healthy weight and control blood pressure to reduce risks of DVT. The client should also avoid alcohol due to the blood thinning properties associated with alcohol combined with the Warfarin therapy. The client should avoid green leafy vegetables since they contain Vitamin K which could decrease the therapeutic effect of the Warfarin. Due to the bleeding risk the client should use an electric razor. It is important for client to take the medication at the same time every day, so he should contact the doctor if a dose is missed for further instruction. Client is a risk for recurrence of DVT and should get out every 1-2 hours while traveling.

Client is a 69 -year-old- male with a recent diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis is seen in emergency department. 

Complete the diagram by dragging from the choices below to specify what condition the client is most likely experiencing, 2 actions the nurse should take to address that condition, and 2 parameters the nurse should monitor to assess the client’s progress.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Pulmonary embolism is the most common complication of deep vein thrombosis. Clinical manifestations include difficulty breathing, inspiratory chest pain and cough. Actions the nurse should take are to elevate the head of the bed in High Fowlers Position to promote oxygenation, and to prepare for a diagnostic CT scan of the chest to confirm the diagnosis. Oxygen is needed; however, the goal is to maintain a saturation of > 95%, not 99%-100% as this may be unrealistic. Antibiotics and blood cultures are not indicated. Arterial blood gasses are indicated; however, the frequency is not realistic or necessary. Respiratory rate, pulse oximetry and cardiac monitoring should be monitored closely. BP should be checked frequently, but not continuously. Renal Function should be checked prior to CT scan with contrast, but not the highest priority for ongoing monitoring.

Case Study Question 1 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 19-year-old wheelchair bound male who has come to the clinic with his mother for a routine checkup.

Which findings are of most concern to the nurse? Select all that apply. 
Bowel sounds
Open area on heel*           
Range of motion
Blood pressure
Light touch sensation in fingers
Foul odor*
Absence of feeling below waist

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Blood pressure, light touch sensation, and bowel sounds are within normal parameters. The range of motion and absence of feeling below waist are expected for a client with paraplegia. A breakdown in skin with a foul odor are not normal findings and require further assessment.

Case Study Question 2 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 19-year-old wheelchair bound male who has come to the clinic with his mother for a routine checkup.

For each potential finding click to indicate if the finding is consistent with pressure injury or venous stasis ulcer. Each potential finding may support more than one type of condition. 
Note: Each column must have at least 1 response option selected. 
Scoring Rule: +/-
 Rationale: Immobility is a risk factor for both venous stasis ulcers and pressure injuries and both may present as shallow. Venous stasis ulcers result from inadequate calf muscle function which results in venous pooling, edema, and impaired microcirculation of the skin. The skin surrounding venous stasis ulcers is reddened or brown and edematous. Pressure injuries are caused by pressure, shear, and friction which result in tissue ischemia and injury and tend to be located over bony prominences.


Case Study Question 3 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 19-year-old wheelchair bound male who has come to the clinic with his mother for a routine checkup.

Drag the most appropriate word from the choices to fill in the blank of the following sentence. 
The nurse should recognize that the client is most likely experiencing

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The assessment data (location over bony prominence, shallow wound, surrounding skin within normal parameters) indicates a stage II pressure injury. The skin surrounding a venous stasis ulcer is typically reddened or brown and edematous. Stage III injuries affect top 2 layers of skin and fatty tissue. A stage IV injury affects muscle, tendons, ligaments or bones.



Case Study Question 4 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 19-year-old wheelchair bound male who has come to the clinic with his mother for a routine checkup.

The wound nurse confirms a stage II pressure injury.
For each potential order, click to specify whether the order is indicated or contraindicated to include in the plan of care.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: There is no indication that the wound requires debridement – a stage II pressure injury does not have slough or necrotic tissue. The wound should be cleaned with an isotonic solution such as normal saline to remove bacteria or other microorganisms. The wound should be dressed to protect it from mechanical injury, protect it from microbial contamination, and provide moist wound healing. A hydrocolloid dressing is appropriate as it will produce a moist environment that facilitates healing and will protect the wound from bacterial contamination. The  client does not need IV antibiotics at this point.


Case Study Question 5 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 19-year-old wheelchair bound male who has come to the clinic with his mother for a routine checkup.

The nurse receives wound care orders.
What 3 actions should the nurse teach the family about wound care? 
Wash hands prior to performing the dressing change *
Massage the right heel each evening to promote blood flow
Monitor for signs of infection *
Elevate heels when in bed*
Eat a diet high in complex carbohydrates
Apply a cold pack to the wound if swelling occurs

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Hand hygiene should be performed prior to dressing changes to prevent introducing microorganisms to the wound. If the wound shows signs of infection this would need to be reported in order to modify the treatment plan. Elevating the heels while in bed will relieve direct pressure. Massage over bony prominences should not be done as this could irritate the area and lead to tissue injury. The client should consume a diet with adequate calories, protein, vitamins, iron, and fluids. A cold pack should not be applied to an open wound as the cold can increase tissue damage by decreasing blood flow to the wound. 
Case Study Question 6 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 19-year-old wheelchair bound male who returns to the clinic two weeks after receiving treatment for a Stage II pressure injury.

The client returns to the clinic and the nurse assesses the client’s pressure injury.
Complete the following sentence by choosing from the list of options.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The wound has decreased in size and has no odor. This indicates that the wound is healing. Since the wound is healing it is not necessary to change the treatment plan and a wound vacuum assisted closure system is not indicated. Interventions that the client’s mother is performing, and pressure injury prevention strategies should be reinforced.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The assessment data (location over bony prominence, shallow wound, surrounding skin within normal parameters) indicates a stage II pressure injury. Wound care will facilitate healing and elevating the heels while in bed will relieve direct pressure. The wound should be monitored for signs of infection. A decrease in wound depth would indicate that the pressure injury was improving.

Which 3 assessment findings are most concerning at this time. 
Blood pressure 
Lung sounds*
Temperature*
Heart rate
Pain in chest*
Respirations 
Pulse oximeter

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Lung sounds, elevated temperature, and complaint of chest pain are all indicative of respiratory alterations consistent with tuberculosis.


Case Study Question 2 of 6 
A 48-year-old female presents to the out-patient clinic in response to contact tracing for possible tuberculosis exposure.

For each assessment finding click to specify if the finding is a risk factor or is not a risk factor for tuberculosis infection. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Asia is a high-risk area for tuberculosis, living in close quarters with others is a risk factor, as is the elevated temperature, cough, and complaints of chest pain.


Case Study Question 3 of 6 
A 48-year-old female presents to the out-patient clinic in response to contact tracing for possible tuberculosis exposure.

The nurse reviews the labs and diagnostic reports.
Drag the most appropriate word from the list of options to complete the following sentence.
The nurse should recognize that the client’s priority problem to address at this time is                                    


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: In prioritizing client needs, airway clearance is not the issue, and there is no evidence of decreased tissue perfusion. There is evidence of mildly altered gas exchange, by the borderline low pulse oximeter and auscultated lung congestion, the risk of spread of infection to others is the priority concern at this time.


Case Study Question 4 of 6 
A 48-year-old female presents to the out-patient clinic in response to contact tracing for possible tuberculosis exposure.

The client is diagnosed with a tuberculosis infection and orders for new medications are received.
For each potential nursing intervention, click to specify whether the intervention is appropriate or not appropriate to include in the plan of care.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: An N95 face mask will protect the nurse from airborne and droplet transmission of tuberculosis, coughing and deep breathing is an important nursing intervention for this client, client should be encouraged to wear a face mask for at least the first 3 weeks of treatment. While contact tracing would be done for close contacts, the nurse would not reveal the client’s identity. Other interventions are not appropriate to this client. 
Case Study Question 5 of 6 
A 48-year-old female presents in response to contact tracing for possible tuberculosis exposure and finds she is symptomatic.

For each client teaching point, click to specify whether the information needs to be provided immediately, at the time of client follow-up, or is not indicated for this client. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Cholesterol is high and the A1C is elevated but is in the “pre-diabetes” range. This should be addressed on the follow-up visit, when the client may be more able to receive information unrelated to presenting problem, there is no need to collect sputum at home since the antibiotic has already been started.


Case Study Question 6 of 6 
A 48-year-old female with tuberculosis is seen in the clinic at a 4-week follow-up appointment.




Complete the following sentence by choosing from the list of options. 
The nurse determines the client’s status is 	improving*
deteriorating
unchanged. 
The nurse should now 				discharge the client home
						review medication teaching*
						admit the client for observation
Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Symptoms are improving, for example improved chest-Xray, lung sounds improved, temperature normal, but client is not adhering strictly to the medication schedule. The client needs medication teaching before being sent home. 

Trend 
A 48-year-old female with tuberculosis is seen in the clinic at a 4-week follow-up appointment.

For each finding, click to specify if the finding indicates the client’s status has improved, declined, or is unchanged. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Elevated blood pressure and missed doses of medication are cause for further assessment and patient education. Abdominal pain could be a sign of a medication side effect off liver involvement Pulse oximeter has increased on room air, temperature is normal, and WBC count is within normal limits. Productive cough and fatigue are unchanged from initial visit.








Rationales: As evidenced by most recent follow-up, the client’s priority problem is knowledge deficit. It will be important for the nurse to review teaching regarding medication action and the need to take each dose as prescribed. A daily log will be a visual reminder for client to take medication on schedule, and will help her assume accountability for self-care.

Which client findings could be consistent with a food allergy? Select all that apply.
Blood pressure
Facial swelling*
Heart rate
Itching*
Respiratory status*
Temperature

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Temperature changes are never a result of a food allergy. Respiratory status, itching, facial swelling, blood pressure and heart rate can be indicative of a reaction. However, blood pressure and heart rate are still within the normal limits for the child’s age.


Case Study Question 3 of 6 
An 8-year-old girl at school is taken from the lunchroom to the nursing office with respiratory issues.

Which condition is the client most likely experiencing? 
Anaphylaxis*
Croup
Status asthmaticus
Airway obstruction

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Child has a known food allergy. Asthma could account for increased work of breathing but typically wheezing is common not stridor. Airway obstruction could be a consideration due to eating lunch and potentially choking. Croup can account for the respiratory issues the child exhibits but fails to explain the hives and itching.

Click to highlight the order the nurse implement first. 

Key

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Injectable epinephrine is indicated as first priority due to the student’s immediate condition; child is in anaphylaxis and a PO medication is not indicated. Albuterol may be used but would not be the first priority and activating EMS would happen after the epinephrine is given.

The nurse conducts a home visit on 68-year-old male client with Parkinson’s disease following a recent fall 3 days after discharge from an acute care setting. 

Drag the 3 findings that need immediate follow-up to the box on the right.



Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Dizziness is symptom related to orthostatic hypotension and can be a side effect of lisinopril. This puts the client at increased risk for falls. Sleep disturbance is not a normal part of aging and needs additional assessment, as fatigue can increase fall risk. The diminished strength in the client’s legs also increases his risk for falls.

For each finding, click to specify if the finding is a risk factor or not a risk factor when conducting a fall risk assessment.


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Medications causing orthostatic hypotension may increase the risk for falls, need for frequent toileting increases need for mobility and use of stairs, history of a fall is a known risk factor for additional falls; advanced age, > 80, is considered a fall risk.



Case Study Question 3 of 6

The nurse completes the environmental assessment. 
What does the nurse determine is the care priority for this client?
Adjust medications
Teach client about orthostatic hypotension
Modify access to toilet facilities*
Obtain rugs to cover wood floor areas


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Modifying access to toilet facilities will address the client’s only need to use the stairs, and reduce his risk for falls. This is an intervention that will increase client’s quality of life and have limited associated expense.
 


Case Study Question 4 of 6 
The nurse conducts a home visit on 68-year-old male client with Parkinson’s disease following a recent fall 3 days after discharge from an acute care setting. 







The nurse develops a plan of care to prevent fall and maximize the client’s quality of life.
For each potential intervention, click to specify whether the intervention is appropriate  or not appropriate  to include in the plan of care.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The client is not ready for extended care facility placement. Flexibility exercises, such as yoga or tai chi, will help promote range-of-motions and balance. Home physical therapy will help maintain strength and flexibility. A bedside commode will enable the client to use the toilet without climbing stairs. Exploring activities of interest and allowing the client time to respond to questions will help keep client engaged and prevent social isolation.
A fluid restriction is not indicated, based on signs of dehydration. Promoting as much independence as possible in self-care is important to client self-esteem. Due to client’s decreased strength and orthostatic hypotension, he should be encouraged to use the walker when ambulating.

Case Study Question 5 of 6 
The nurse conducts a home visit on 68-year-old male client with Parkinson’s disease following a recent fall 3 days after discharge from an acute care setting. 







The nurse provides education for on-going care to the client and son. 
Specify whether action should or should not be included in the teaching plan. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Clients with Parkinson’s disease should be encouraged to participate in self-care for as long as possible. This helps with both motor skills and self-esteem. Lisinopril can cause orthostatic hypotension, so instruction on standing up slowly is important. Wearing socks on the wood floor increases the risk for falls. Instead, the client should always wear shoes. Making the toilet more accessible is a healthier option to decreasing fluid because dehydration can contribute to the risk for falls. Weightlifting is not considered a safe activity for clients with decreased strength.   Focus on flexibility and stretching is more beneficial that strength training in Parkinson’s disease. Using the bedside commode is a safety intervention to prevent the use of stairs when unattended. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive degenerative disease that will not be cured by medication. Carbidopa/levodopa can help with symptoms of shakiness and trouble moving, but will not prevent disease progression.
Case Study Question 6 of 6 
The nurse conducts a return home visit 3 months later on 68-year-old male client with Parkinson’s disease and a history of falls. 

The nurse returns in 3 months to re-evaluate the client. 
For each finding, click to specify if the finding indicates that the client’s status has improved, declined, or is unchanged. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Changes in cognition such as confusion and irritability and declining speech capability are signs of progressing disease. No fall shows in 3 months shows interventions have been effective. Joining a support group  and an online yoga class demonstrate an understanding of disease progression and positive interventions. The client was using a walker and had dizziness upon standing at the initial visit.

Complete the diagram by dragging from the choices below to specify what priority condition the client is most likely to experience, 2 actions the nurse should take to address that condition, and 2 parameters the nurse should monitor to assess the client’s progress.



Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Safety is a priority concern for clients with Parkinson disease. The client’s greatest fall risk is going upstairs to use the toilet. Access could be modified with a commode. Flexibility training will decrease risk of falls. Changing medications and extended care placement are not yet indicated. A speech referral will not. Continuous monitoring of coordination, balance, strength and range of motion will alert the nurse to changes needed in the care environment and the disease progresses.

Case Study 1 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 25-year-old male with a history of HIV admitted the the medical surgical unit with respiratory distress. 

The nurse reviews the client's laboratory report.
Which lab findings are concerning? Select all that apply 
Hematocrit
Platelets  
Sodium 
CD4-T cells *
Potassium 
WBC *

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: As the HIV virus replicates, the CD 4 count declines due to the virus's destruction of T cells. Normal range of CD4 cells is 800-1200 cells/ mm3.  When the CD4 cell count goes below 500, the person is subseptable to opportunistic infections.  When the CD4 count falls below < 200/ mm3,  this indicates the viral load is high, and an HIV+ client has seroconverted to having AIDS.  Elevated WBCs indicates the client is experiencing an infection
Case Study 2 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 25-year-old male with a history of HIV admitted the the medical surgical unit with respiratory distress. 

Which clients findings are risks for for an opportunistic infection? Select all that apply. 
Three year use of antiretroviral medications 
History of HIV*
Being 25 years old
Use of over-the-counter medications 
Stopped taking his medication *
Low CD4 T cell counts*

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Discontinuation of HIV medications allows the client’s viral load to increase. As the viral load increases, the CD4 T cell count decreases making the client vulnerable to opportunistic infections. Clients are typically given the diagnosis of AIDS when the CD4 count falls below 200mm3 


Case Study 3 of 6
The nurse cares for a 25-year-old male with a history of HIV admitted the the medical surgical unit with respiratory distress. 

The nurse reviews the client's chart. 
Complete the sentence from the list of word choices.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The priority is to address the client’s oxygenation. Oxygen should be immediately be started on oxygen. Clients with HIV infections and CD4 counts < 200/mm3  are subseptable to opportunistic infections.The next priority is to treat the infection. The client will need to resume antiretroviral therapy to improve their immune system, but this improvement will occur more slowly. The fever will need to be treated, but treating the infection is most important to recovery.


Case Study 4 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 25-year-old male with a history of HIV admitted the the medical surgical unit with respiratory distress. 

The client is diagnosed with pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).
For each potential order click to specify if it is anticipated or not anticipated to include in the plan of care?



Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale:  Clinical manifestations of pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) include fever, chills, and flu-like symptoms. Ibuprofen is ordered to reduce fever and oxygen  is needed to support respiratory compromise due to lung infection.  Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are medications effective against PCP. Vancomycin is not effective against fungal infections. Clinical manifestations of PCP do not include sore throa, so gargling with lidocaine solution is not indicated. The client has no history of cardiovascular illness; therefore, the stress test is not indicated. A social work consult is needed because the client is out of work, without insurance, and is experiencing a long-term illness.

Case Study 5 of 6
The nurse cares for a 25-year-old male with a history of HIV admitted the the medical surgical unit with respiratory distress. 

The nurse teaches the client about how to reduce the risks of opportunistic infections.
What should the nurse teach the client about preventing opportunistic infections? Select all that apply.
Use frequent hand washing *
Get tested for tuberculosis *
Get an HIV test every 4 months 
Get tested for an sexually transmitted infections *
Get a yearly influenza vaccine *
Don’t drink untreated water*
Have a monthly complete blood count 
Have viral load testing every 4 to 6 months *
Take antiviral medications as ordered *


Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Hand washing is a major strategy to prevent of infection. Drinking untreated water puts cleints at risk for waterbourne diseases. HIV+ clients should be routinely tested for tubercoluosis and sexually transmitted infections. Annual immunization for the flu is recommended for immunocompromised patients. HIV+ patients should submit to a frequent check of their viral loads to assess their ability to fight opportunistic infections. A daily regime of antiviral medications effectively preserves immune function and reduces complications related to HIV infections. An HIV test every 4 months is not needed once a diagnosis is made. Monthly CBC are not needed.  


Case Study 6 of 6
The nurse cares for a 25-year-old male with a history of HIV admitted the the medical surgical unit with respiratory distress. 

The nurse assesses the client’s understanding of the teaching provided on reducing risk of opportunistic infections.
For each potential client statement click to specify if the statement indicates understanding or no understanding of the teaching provided. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Goals of education include helping the client develop new skills and behaviors to adapt to their medical condition and develop strategies to improve their health status. The correct responses reflect understanding behaviors to control infection and maintain a healthy lifestyle for a client that has an HIV infection.


Trend
The nurse cares for a 25-year-old male with a history of HIV admitted the the medical surgical unit with respiratory distress.

The nurse reassessed the client at Day 2. 
For each client findings, click to indicate if the finding reflects that  client's condition has improved or is unchanged. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The client’s temperature, pulse, respirations were elevated and abnormal on admission.  The pulse oximeter was low.  On day two, the client’s temperature, pulse, repirations and pulse oximeter % are within normal limits. Coughing has decreased and the client is not short of breath.  The client’s blood pressure is consistently within normal limits.

Case Study Question 1 of 6 
A 73-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes presented to the emergency department due to a change in mental status.


Which 4 findings are most significant?  
Lung sounds 
History of type II diabetes*
Respiratory status*
Circulation*
Pupils 
Temperature
Mental status*
Medications

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Because the client has a history of type II diabetes, the nurse should follow up with signs that the client’s diabetes may be out of control such as the deep and rapid respirations, the odor on the breath, and mental changes. The low B/P and tachycardia can indicate severe hypovolemia.    


Case Study Question 2 of 6 
A 73-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes presented to the emergency department due to a change in mental status.


The nurse starts an IV and reviews the labs.
For each finding click to specify if it is consistent with ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome. Each finding may support more than one condition. Each column must have at least 1 correct option.


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Serum blood glucose levels in diabetic ketoacidosis can fluctuate between 300 and 800mg/dl. It is typically above 600 mg/dL with HHS. Low pH and urine ketones are seen with DKA. Those values are typically normal with HHS. Both conditions can cause dehydration and elevated creatine.  
Case Study Question 3 of 6 
A 73-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes presented to the emergency department due to a change in mental status.

Complete the sentence from the list of drop-down options.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The priority for care is to restore volume so the client has adequate perfusion. Once the volume is improved, insulin therapy can begin to slowly bring the glucose down. The client will be monitored to determine if the acidosis is getting worse, giving sodium bicarbonate is not done unless the pH is <6.9 

Case Study Question 4 of 6
73-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes presented to the emergency department due to a change in mental status.

The client is diagnosed with ketoacidosis and the nurse begins to plan care.
For each nursing intervention, click to specify whether the intervention is indicated, contraindicated or non-essential. 


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The nurse monitors fingerstick glucoses. The glycosylated hemoglobin A1C is not a good indicator to determine the effectiveness of treatment. Pursed-lipped breathing will help slow the pace of breathing. Treatment for DKA is with regular insulin, not glargine, because it can given IV and titrated to slowly achieve goals. The client's urine output should be measured with a urinal. Clients with diabetes have a high risk of developing infections and a high risk of delayed healing time, thereby an indwelling catheter poses a greater risk for infection. Cardiovascular changes can be observed with mild acidosis. Prolonged and untreated acidosis can lead to the onset of hyperkalemia. The heart rate will decrease, T waves become tall and peaked, and the QRS complex widens. Conversely, hypokalemia can result with insulin therapy; potassium replacement is initiated when serum levels fall below the normal range. 


Case Study Question 5 of 6
73-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes presented to the emergency department due to a change in mental status.

The nurse reviews orders the orders.
What actions should the nurse take while implementing the treatment plan? Select all that apply
Begin insulin after bolus at 0.9 Units/hr  
Anticipate holding insulin for low potassium levels * 
Request IV fluids with dextrose when glucose levels start to normalize*
Allow client to client to eat when status stabilizes *
Monitor for symptoms of fluid overload*

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale. Hypokalemia can result with insulin therapy. Insulin is typically held if levels fall below 3.3mEq/L. Dextrose is added to IV fluids when glucose levels stabilize to prevent hypoglycemia. Clients can eat when their respiratory status is stable, and they feel like eating. During the initial phase of treating the client for DKA, the nurse should  monitor the client’s status to prevent the onset of fluid overload. The client weighs 93 kg so based on orders the starting rate would be 9.3 Units/hr.

Case Study Question 6 of 6 
73-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes presented to the emergency department due to a change in mental status.

The nurse reassesses the client after giving a fluid bolus and starting the insulin infusion.

Which findings indicate the treatment plan has been effective?  Select all that apply. 
Blood pressure *
Mental status *
Breath sounds 
Pulse 100 bpm *
Capillary glucose
Pain levels 

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis focuses on managing and correcting the serum glucose along with correcting dehydration, electrolyte imbalances and acidosis. With the administration of the intravenous fluids and the insulin infusion, the accumulated ketone bodies are reversed, thereby correcting the acidotic state, and ending the production of ketones from the fat breakdown. Reversal of the ketone production and correction of the fluid and electrolyte imbalance, the compensatory mechanisms are stimulated. The blood pressure will increase, and the heart rate will decrease. With the cells being rehydrated and glucose moving into the cells, the client's neurological status should improve. Pain was not a primary issue and breath sounds were clear to start. The blood glucose has  not yet begun to decrease.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The labs indicate the client has diabetic ketoacidosis an acute complication of diabetes evidenced by the hyperglycemia, acidosis, and production of ketones.  Treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis focuses on managing and correcting the serum glucose along with correcting dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. With the administration of the intravenous fluids and the insulin infusion the accumulated ketone bodies are reversed thereby correcting the acidotic state and ending the production of ketones from the fat breakdown.  The nurse closely monitors blood glucose and adjust insulin accordingly. With the cells being rehydrated and glucose moving into the cells the client's neurological status should improve.

The 16-year-old client is seen in the Emergency Department for evaluation of fainting episodes.
Click to highlight the 3 findings that require immediate follow-up.

Key

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Decreased urine output and poor skin turgor are signs of dehydration and require immediate follow up. The B/P listed is hypotensive and most likely requires intervention. Amenorrhea, lanugo and constipation are signs of prolonged malnutrition and not life-threatening complications.



Case Study Question 2 of 6 
The 16-year-old client is seen in the Emergency Department for evaluation of fainting episodes.

The nurse reviews the client’s history of anorexia and  potential causes of the most urgent presenting symptoms.   
For each finding click to indicate if the finding is consistent with dehydration, hypoglycemia, or anemia. Each finding may support more than one type of condition. 
Note: Each column must have at least 1 response option selected. 

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Dehydration typically results in poor skin turgor, hypotension, decreased urine output,  and can result in syncope. Hypoglycemia can cause hypotension and syncope.  Anemia can cause hypotension and decreased urine output.* Anemia is also seen in clients with renal disease.

Case Study Question 3 of 6 
The 16-year-old client is seen in the Emergency Department for evaluation of fainting episodes.

The labs return and the nurse obtains orthostatic vital signs. 
Complete the following sentence by choosing from the list of options.


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The changes in the blood pressure indicate orthostatic hypotension and hypovolemia. The client glucose is within defined parameters. While the hemoglobin and hematocrit are slightly low, they are not low enough to explain  the client’s symptoms. 


Case Study Question 4 of 6 
The 16-year-old client is seen in the Emergency Department for evaluation of fainting episodes.

The nurse begins to plan the client’s care.
For each potential order, click to specify whether the order is appropriate or not appropriate to include in the plan of care.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The client needs to begin gradual refeeding and would not be NPO. The client has no evidence of dysphagia and would not need tube feedings. The client has a low K+ and would benefit from potassium supplementation. The client is hypovolemic and needs fluid replacement. Anorexic clients need strict I & O to ensure adequate intake and that no purging is occurring. The anorexic client will also need a daily weight and psychiatric consult. The client’s fear of gaining weight is a sign of unmanaged anorexia. The client shows no signs of infection and would not need contact isolation. Liquid nutritional supplements can assist with caloric intake and prevention of refeeding syndrome. 

Case Study Question 5 of 6 
16-year-old client with fainting episodes is admitted to the medical surgical unit to treat the dehydration.

The nurse receives orders.
Which tasks can the nurse delegate to the UAP? Select all that apply.
Obtain and record daily weights *
Take and document routine vital signs *
Take and document orthostatic vital signs *
Give client potassium 20mEq PO
Record and document intake and output*
Educate client on medical complications of anorexia.
Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: The UAP cannot administer medications, draw routine labs or educate the client on medical complications of anorexia. The UAP may document and take weights and vital signs. The UAP can document strict intake and output.

Case Study Question 6 of 6 
16-year-old client with fainting episodes is admitted to the medical surgical unit to treat the dehydration.

The nurse has implemented the treatment plan and provided education on the medical complications and the psychosocial components of anorexia. 
For each finding, click to specify if the statement indicates an understanding, or no understanding of the education provided. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The client needs to develop non-food coping skills. The client should be discharged into a partial hospitalization program for further support as anorexia does not resolve quickly. The severe body image distortion and maladaptive coping skills need to be addressed further after discharge. The lanugo developed from insufficient fat on the client’s body. The hypovolemia was caused by dehydration. The client and family should avoid talking only about food as this can support the client’s fixation with weight.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The client is most likely experiencing dehydration. There is no evidence of severe anemia, hypoglycemia or shock at this time. The client needs potassium supplementation and IV fluids to correct the fluid and electrolyte imbalance. The client does not need a blood transfusion at this time, oxygen levels are stable, and no oxygen is needed. Urine output will need to be monitored to assess improved fluid balance. Blood glucose does not need to be checked as the client has no signs of hypoglycemia. Pulse oximetry is not needed as this is stable. The client needs routine electrolyte monitoring but there is no need to monitor hemoglobin and hematocrit as this is stable.

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: The client’s vital signs are similar to baseline. The nurse should recognize the new symptoms are skin changes & itching. 

Case Study Question 2 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 65- year- old male with cancer who needs a blood transfusion in the outpatient-clinic.

For each client finding, click to indicate if the finding is consistent with acute hemolytic, mild allergic, anaphylactic, or circulatory overload transfusion reactions. Each finding may support more than one type of transfusion reaction. 
Note: Each column must have at least 1 response option selected. 

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: The nurse would suspect a transfusion reaction but needs to think quickly through which types of reaction might be occurring. The nurse would analyze the client cues and compare and contrast different types of transfusion reactions. Flushing is caused by changes in circulation and can be seen in all types of transfusion reaction. Hives and itching are signs of an allergic reactions which can be mild or severe as in anaphylaxis. The client’s heart rate and respiratory status are stable. Symptoms of shock would be expected with hemolytic or anaphylactic reactions. Circulatory overload would manifest as respiratory changes and tachycardia.

Drag from the word choices to fill in the blank of the following sentence. 
The nurse should recognize that the client is most likely experiencing a/an					transfusion reaction.


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Based on the stable vital signs with skin changes, the nurse would most suspect that the client is having a mild allergic reaction to a foreign protein in the donor blood. 

Case Study Question 4 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 65- year- old male with cancer who needs a blood transfusion in the outpatient-clinic.

Select the orders from each of the category the nurse anticipates including in the plan of care. Each category may have more than one order.

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: When a transfusion reaction is suspected, the plan of care includes stopping the transfusion and starting normal saline. Mild transfusion reactions are treated with an antihistamine. If the transfusion cannot be continued, blood tubing is sent to lab not discarded. Tubing should remain on the unit if there is a chance the transfusion will resume. Blood cultures would be indicated if blood contamination was suspected, but there was no fever. An indwelling catheter is indicated if shock was suspected, or hematuria was present. 


Case Study Question 5 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 65- year- old male with cancer who needs a blood transfusion in the outpatient-clinic.

The healthcare provider determines the client is experiencing a mild allergic reaction and orders diphenhydramine. 
What should the nurse teach the client about the treatment plan? Select all that apply 
The symptoms are signs of blood incompatibilities causing red blood cell destruction. 
Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine to help decrease the itching. * 
The main side effect of antihistamines is agitation.
Immediately report any difficulty breathing or back pain.* 
If symptoms improve in 30 minutes the transfusion can resume slowly.*
Pretreatment with antihistamines may be needed for future transfusions.*

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: When a mild allergic transfusion reaction is suspected, the client is given an antihistamine and observed 30 minutes. If symptoms resolve, the transfusion can continue. Clients should be instructed to report difficulty breathing or back pain as these are signs the client is developing a more serious reaction. Pretreatment with antihistamines is typically needed for future transfusions in sensitive individuals. The suspected cause of the reaction is to a foreign protein, not an ABO or Rh incompatibility. The most common side effect of antihistamines is drowsiness.         

Case Study Question 6 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 65- year- old male with cancer who needs a blood transfusion in the outpatient-clinic.

Case Study Question 1 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 47 year-old male on the post-surgical unit the second day after an appendectomy.  

Which findings require immediate follow-up? Select all that apply. 

Heart Rate 110 *
Blood Pressure 132/84
Respirations are 26 *
Requesting pain medication for 5/10 pain
Breath sounds are diminished on the left *
Feeling short of breath *
Pulse oximeter reading of 92% on RA *
Requesting an update from the physician

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale:  The nurse should identify signs and symptoms of post-operative complications that need to be addressed.  Signs of atelectasis include increased heart rate, increased respirations, breathing difficulties and low oxygen levels.  Breath sounds will be diminished due to collapsed alveoli.  Blood pressure is not affected unless it becomes elevated due to the stress of breathing difficulties.  Pain medication is important but first the breathing issues must be addressed.


Case Study Question 2 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 47 year-old male on the post-surgical unit the second day after an appendectomy.  

The nurse considers conditions that can cause post-operative respiratory distress. 
For each client finding click to indicate if the finding is consistent with pneumonia,  post-operative atelectasis, pulmonary embolism, or fluid overload. Each finding may support more than one type of condition. 
Note: Each column must have at least 1 response option selected 
Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale:  The nurse should differentiate signs and symptoms of atelectasis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and fluid overload in clients with respiratory distress following surgery. All respiratory issues include shortness of breath and increased respirations, and decreased pulse oximeter readings. Diminished breath sounds and repressed coughing are most associated with post-op atelectasis. Coughing, rhonchi, wheezing, or crackles would be expected with the other three conditions.  Low-grade fever and normal and stable blood pressures would be expected with atelectasis and pneumonia. Fever could also be higher with pneumonia.  Unstable blood pressures would be expected for pulmonary embolism or fluid overload. Hypotension is typically seen with pulmonary embolism. Hypertension is associated with fluid overload.

Drag the most appropriate word from the choices to fill in the blank of the following sentence. 
The nurse should recognize that the client is most likely experiencing 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The client’s respiratory findings along with the diminished breath sounds, repressed cough,  low grade fever and stable blood pressure most suggest the client is  experiencing atelectasis. 


Case Study Question 4 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 47 year-old male on the post-surgical unit the second day after an appendectomy.  

The client is diagnosed with mild atelectasis.
For each potential order, click to specify whether the intervention is indicated or not indicated to include in the plan of care.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale:  The XRAY confirms atelectasis. Proper nursing interventions include sitting the client up to aid with breathing.  Supine position can make breathing more difficult.  Applying oxygen via nasal cannula can also make breathing easier.  Using the incentive spirometer can also make breathing easier. Controlling pain improves compliance with incentive spirometry.  Extra fluid does not help a client with breathing and can put the client at risk for fluid overload.  A CBC is not necessary for monitoring atelectasis as it would be for detecting and infection.
Case Study Question 5 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 47 year-old male on the post-surgical unit the second day after an appendectomy.  

The nurse is developing a teaching plan with the client. 
What should the nurse teach the client about the treatment plan? Select all that apply. 
Get out of bed and ambulate in the hall *
Sit upright when using the incentive spirometer *
Importance of taking deep breaths *
Limiting fluid intake
Avoid use of pain medication right before using incentive spirometer
How to splint the incision during coughing*
Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale:   The nurse should teach the client with atelectasis interventions that can improve their oxygenation.   The nurse can instruct the client to be out of bed and ambulate, to take deep breaths in order to increase lung capacity and open up the alveoli.  The incentive spirometer can also help improve lung function.  The client should increase the fluids to about 3,000 ml /day to thin mucous secretions, and use pain medication so they can take deep breaths.  



Case Study Question 6 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 47 year-old male on the post-surgical unit the second day after an appendectomy.  

The nurse reassesses the client at 1500.
For each potential finding, click to specify if the finding indicates that the client’s status has improved, declined, or is unchanged. 


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale:  The nurse should recognize that the client has improved if the oxygen saturation is within normal limits and the client is coughing after using the incentive spirometer. Breath sounds were diminished on left and make take several cycles of deep breathing and coughing to improve. The increasing fever would indicate that the client’s condition had decreased and a infection may now be present.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale:  Atelectasis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and fluid overload in clients can all cause  respiratory distress following surgery. Diminished breath sounds and repressed coughing are most associated with post-op atelectasis. Coughing, rhonchi, wheezing, or crackles would be expected with the other three conditions.  Low-grade fever and normal and stable blood pressures would be expected with atelectasis and pneumonia. Fever could also be higher with pneumonia.  Unstable blood pressures would be expected for pulmonary embolism or fluid overload. Hypotension is typically seen with pulmonary embolism. Hypertension is associated with fluid overload. The nurse should apply oxygen by a nasal cannula, request a chest- Xray, and encourage the incentive spirometer. The client’s pulse oximeter readings are not low enough to need a non-rebreather and use of that device would limit the client’s ability to use an incentive spirometer.  Diuretics  would be needed for fluid overload and antibiotics would be needed for pneumonia. Diminished breath sounds and low pulse oximeter readings alerted the nurse to the problem; therefor it is appropriate to monitor the client to determine they have returned to baseline.

Case Study Question 1 of 6 
The nurse on the medical-surgical unit is caring for a 69-year-old male client with pain and swelling of the right lower extremity. 

Which 4 findings are most concerning? 
2+ pedal edema*
Pain 8/10 in right calf*
Warmth noted to right calf*
Positive motion R lower extremity
Right pedal pulse weak*
Right lower extremity elevated
Blood Pressure 145/82
HR 96
Positive sensation R lower extremity

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The nurse should recognize the following as signs of a possible deep vein thrombosis: pedal edema, calf pain, warmth to right calf, and a weak pedal pulse. Positive motion and sensation are expected, and not concerning. Blood pressure and heart rate are borderline, which is likely related to the pain rate and not a primary concern. The right lower extremity and bedrest orders must be followed but are not overall concerning about the client’s health condition.

Drag the most appropriate word from the choices to fill in the blank of the following sentence. 
The nurse should recognize that the client is most likely experiencing

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale:  The most likely cause of the client’s symptoms are right leg deep vein thrombosis(DVT). While some symptoms are consistent with other potential causes such as a sprain or infection the only diagnosis consistent with all of the client’s symptoms is DVT.


Case Study Question 4 of 6 
The nurse on the medical-surgical unit is caring for a 69-year-old male client with pain and swelling of the right lower extremity.  

Nurses’ notes have been updated with most recent radiology results.
For each potential intervention, click to specify whether the intervention is indicated or not indicated to include in the plan of care.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The nurse should anticipate anticoagulation therapy which may include an initial bolus dose of heparin followed by a continuous infusion. The heparin will require baseline PTT and consistent monitoring of the PTT every 6 hours per protocol. Compression stockings and elevating the right lower extremity are indicated. Ambulation is contraindicated until anticoagulation has begun due to the risk of mobilizing the venous thromboembolism.  Massage is also contraindicated because of risk of mobilizing the thrombus.


Case Study Question 5 of 6 
The nurse on the medical-surgical unit is caring for a 69-year-old male client with pain and swelling of the right lower extremity.  

The nurse reviews the physician’s orders.
For each order, click to specify if the nurse should implement the order immediately, within the next hour, or before the end of the shift.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The nurse should have the Pt/PTT drawn immediately since it is a stat order and the heparin cannot be started until it is completed. Both the bolus dose and initial infusion of Heparin should begin within the hour to prevent further extension of the DVT. The re-draw of the PTT should occur 6 hours after the initial dose per orders. Strict bedrest should be implemented immediately to prevent mobilizing the clot. Compression stockings will likely need to be obtained from supply and can be placed before the end of the shift. The right leg should be elevated sooner rather than later, but is not a first priority. Monitoring for signs of bleeding is not indicated until the first dose of heparin is initiated but should begin concurrently with the administration of the bolus dose of heparin.


Case Study Question 6 of 6 
The nurse on the Medical-Surgical unit is caring for a 69-year-old male client with pain and swelling of the right lower extremity.  

The client is reassessed on the third day and discharge orders are received.
Which client statements indicate the teaching was understood? Select All That Apply.
“To relieve my stress, I should have a glass of wine before dinner.”
“I will eat more spinach and kale every day.”
“I will throw away my straight razor and buy an electric one.”*
“If I miss a dose of my medicine, I will contact my doctor.”*
“Controlling my blood pressure is not important.”
“When I travel, I will get out and walk every 3-4 hours.”
“I set an alarm, so I take my medicine the same time daily.”*
Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: The client should maintain a healthy weight and control blood pressure to reduce risks of DVT. The client should also avoid alcohol due to the blood thinning properties associated with alcohol combined with the Warfarin therapy. The client should avoid green leafy vegetables since they contain Vitamin K which could decrease the therapeutic effect of the Warfarin. Due to the bleeding risk the client should use an electric razor. It is important for client to take the medication at the same time every day, so he should contact the doctor if a dose is missed for further instruction. Client is a risk for recurrence of DVT and should get out every 1-2 hours while traveling.

Client is a 69 -year-old- male with a recent diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis is seen in emergency department. 

Complete the diagram by dragging from the choices below to specify what condition the client is most likely experiencing, 2 actions the nurse should take to address that condition, and 2 parameters the nurse should monitor to assess the client’s progress.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Pulmonary embolism is the most common complication of deep vein thrombosis. Clinical manifestations include difficulty breathing, inspiratory chest pain and cough. Actions the nurse should take are to elevate the head of the bed in High Fowlers Position to promote oxygenation, and to prepare for a diagnostic CT scan of the chest to confirm the diagnosis. Oxygen is needed; however, the goal is to maintain a saturation of > 95%, not 99%-100% as this may be unrealistic. Antibiotics and blood cultures are not indicated. Arterial blood gasses are indicated; however, the frequency is not realistic or necessary. Respiratory rate, pulse oximetry and cardiac monitoring should be monitored closely. BP should be checked frequently, but not continuously. Renal Function should be checked prior to CT scan with contrast, but not the highest priority for ongoing monitoring.

Case Study Question 1 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 60- year- old male admitted to the Emergency Department with chest pain.

The nurse reviews the diagnostic and laboratory findings.
Which 2 findings are most significant? 
ECG*
Cholesterol 
Platelets
White  blood cell count
Troponin T*
Creatine kinase 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: An ECG of sinus tachycardia with ST segment elevation indicates there is damage to the cardiac muscle and should be addressed immediately. Elevated troponin T is specific for myocardial injury. Creatine kinase-MB can be used as a test for myocardial cell death but is also commonly found in other sites, so it is not specific to the myocardium. The cholesterol is elevated but not diagnostic for a myocardial infarction. Platelets and white blood cell counts are normal.  

Case Study Question 2 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 60- year- old male admitted to the Emergency Department with chest pain.

For each client finding , click to specify whether the finding is consistent with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI),  Non ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI),  or unstable angina. Each finding may be consistent with more than one condition. 
Note: Each column must have at least one option selected.
Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Obesity, elevated cholesterol, and crushing chest pain are associated with all  three acute coronary syndromes. Cardiac biomarkers are not elevated with unstable angina. The EKG findings show ST elevation which indicates significant cardiac damage associated with an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).


Case Study Question 3 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 60- year- old male admitted to the Emergency Department with chest pain.

Complete the following sentence by selecting from the list of drop downs. 

Scoring Rule: Rationale
Rationale: The clients labs and symptoms are congruent with STEMI. STEMI occurs when there is sudden rupture of an unstable part of the wall in a heart artery followed by the build- up of a clot in an attempt to heal it. This clot formation results in total blockage of the artery and loss of blood supply to the heart. 
Case Study Question 4 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 60- year- old male admitted to the Emergency Department with chest pain.

The client receives a diagnosis of ST elevation myocardial infarction.
For each potential medication order, click to specify whether the medication is indicated or not indicated to include in the plan of care.


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Acute care for STEMI includes pain management, establishing perfusion, and limiting ischemic damage. Analgesics, typically morphine, are given for pain. Ischemia is limited by decreasing perfusion needs.  Beta blockers can be given to control lower heart rate and blood pressure. Reperfusion therapy can be medical or manual. Medical therapy includes giving a fibrinolytic to dissolve any blood clots that may be present blocking blood vessels. Anti- coagulants prevent worsening obstruction. Fluid boluses would increase cardiac load. There is no evidence of infection to need antibiotics.


Case Study Question 5 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 60- year- old male admitted to the Emergency Department with chest pain.

The nurse receives orders.
Complete the sentence from the list of drop down options

Scoring Rule: Rationale
Rationale: Tenecteplase is a tissue plasma activator that works to dissolve any blood clots that block blood vessels. The standard of care is to give the medication within 30 minutes of arrival if a STEMI is diagnosed.



Case Study Question 6 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 60- year- old male admitted to the Emergency Department with chest pain.

The nurse reassesses the client after initiating the chest-pain protocol and giving tenecteplase.
For each finding, click to specify if the finding indicates that the client’s status has improved, declined, or is unchanged. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The blood pressure,  pulse oximeter, and pain level have all improved after the client received oxygen per nasal cannula, nitroglycerin, morphine, and tenecteplase. The client’s heart rate has increased, this could be an indicator of the heart muscle attempting to pump more oxygenated blood to the tissues. The client’s respiratory rate is unchanged.

Complete the diagram by dragging from the choices below to specify what condition the client is most likely experiencing, 2 actions the nurse should take to address that condition, and 2 parameters the nurse should monitor to assess the client’s progress.


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The actions and monitoring for a client with acute coronary syndrome help determine next steps in treatment.  Administering oxygen and nitroglycerin help to improve the oxygenation of the blood cells and vasodilate the vessels to improve blood flow to the heart muscle.  Improving ischemic pain indicates improved perfusion. The pulse oximeter should be equal or more than 95% to have adequate oxygenation. Low-dose aspirin is not indicated for a myocardial infarction client however aspirin should be given in higher doses. Tenecteplase may be given to a client with ST elevation EMI, however it is done after confirmation of the diagnosis.

The nurse is caring for a 67-yr-old male  with history of alcohol use disorder and cirrhosis admitted to the medical-surgical unit. 

The nurse assesses the client upon admission to the unit. 
Which 2 findings are the most concerning?
Blood pressure
BUN
Neurologic assessment*
Peripheral edema
Dyspnea*
Albumin level
Glucose
Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The most concerning signs are dyspnea which indicates hepatopulmonary syndrome from worsening ascites, as well as a decline in neurologic function (drowsy off and on, oriented to name only, slightly agitated, etc.). BUN slightly elevated but due to dehydration vs. acute kidney failure as creatinine is normal. A low serum albumin level is expected due to cirrhosis and malnourished condition from alcohol use disorder.

The nurse is caring for a 67-yr-old male  with history of alcohol use disorder and cirrhosis admitted to the medical-surgical unit. 

For each finding, click to specify if the finding is most consistent with the condition of ascites or elevated ammonia.  


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale:  Ascites (a complication of portal hypertension and low albumin from cirrhosis/liver damage) can result in respiratory compromise while deterioration in neurologic status (confusion and agitation) results from increased ammonia levels causing hepatic encephalopathy.
Case Study Question 3 of 6 
The nurse is caring for a 67-yr-old male client with history of alcohol use disorder and cirrhosis admitted to the medical-surgical unit.

Complete the following sentence by choosing from the list of options.



Scoring Rule: Rationale
Rationale: Hepatic encephalopathy is a common complication of cirrhosis and is caused by inability of the liver to detoxify protein by-products. This results in increased ammonia levels which can be toxic to the CNS.  Abnormal neurological findings which are common indicators of hepatic encephalopathy include confusion, lethargy, dozing on and off, restlessness and agitation.

The client receives the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy.
For each potential intervention, click to specify whether the intervention is indicated, not indicated, contraindicated in  the plan of care.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: Interventions  are focused on treating both ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. Acetaminophen and sedatives are contraindicated as is placing the client flat in bed when dyspneic due to ascites. Glucose monitoring would not harm the client but is not necessary.

Complete the diagram by dragging from the choices below to specify what condition the client is most likely experiencing, 2 actions the nurse should take to address that condition, and 2 parameters the nurse should monitor to assess the client’s progress.


Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale:  Based on neurologic status/confusion and agitation due to elevated ammonia level, the client is experiencing hepatic encephalopathy. Interventions include giving lactulose to lower ammonia levels by inducing diarrhea and maintaining safety/preventing injury until confusion and agitation subsides. While furosemide may be ordered the purpose of this medication is to reduce ascites and alleviate potential for pulmonary complications. Sedatives are contraindicated in persons with liver failure. Client is acutely ill therefore not appropriate to perform education on alcohol cessation until more stable and when readiness can be assessed.

A client in the 4th stage of labor is being cared for following a cesarean birth.
Click to highlight the findings that require immediate follow-up. 



Key

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: The concerning findings are the client stating she feels dizzy, appearing pale, additional blood loss and the bogginess and position of the uterus.  Concerning vital signs are pulse, BP and pulse oximeter. The quantitative blood loss after the cesarean is within normal limits (up to 1000 mL for cesarean delivery).  More than 1000 mL in 24 hours qualifies as postpartum hemorrhage after cesarean.  Additional 400 mL puts the client at a total loss of 1300 mL.  Infant weight is WNL. 





Case Study Question 2 of 6 
A client in the 4th stage of labor is being cared for following a cesarean birth.

For each finding click to indicate if the finding is consistent with septic shock, cardiogenic shock, or hemorrhagic shock. Each finding may support more than one type of shock. 
Note: Each column must have at least 1 option selected.

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Hypotension and tachycardia occur in all three types of shock.  Pale and cool skin is indicative of cardiogenic or hemorrhagic shock.  Blood loss only occurs in hemorrhagic shock. Dizziness with poor perfusion in all forms of shock.

A client in the 4th stage of labor is being cared for following a cesarean birth.

Select the orders from each of the categories the nurse should include in the plan of care. Each category may have more than one order.

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Expected actions are fundal massage to stimulate contractions, weighing of the peripads for quantitative blood loss, oxygen, and pulse oximetry.  Clear liquids would not be appropriate at this time. The provider would order a type and cross for potential transfusion and Hct &Hbg to monitor recovery.  Colloid fluids help replace lost fluids and uterotonics help contract the uterus to prevent further blood loss.


Case Study Question 5 of 6 
A client in the 4th stage of labor is being cared for following a cesarean birth.

Which 4 orders should the nurse implement first?

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The most important actions are to stop the bleeding and maintain circulation. Massaging the fundus stimulates contraction, which should stop the bleeding.  Uterotonics also serve to contract the uterus to stop bleeding.  The fluid bolus and oxygen are necessary to restore perfusion because blood pressure has dropped, and the client states they feel dizzy. The patient may require a blood transfusion but there are nursing interventions that can be done first.

Case Study Question 1 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 23-year-old male in the Emergency Department who is experiencing acute onset of shortness of breath.

The nurse assesses the client on admission.
Which findings require immediate follow-up. Select all that apply.
  
Shortness of breath*
Chest tightness*
Respiratory rate*
Dry cough*
Audible and expiratory wheezing*
Tripod position*
Speaks only a few words between breaths*
Blood pressure 
Tenderness of chest wall

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale:  The nurse should recognize pertinent objective data (tachypnea, cough, wheezing, tripod position, and speaking in short phrases) and subjective data (shortness of breath and tightness in the chest) indicate respiratory distress associated with bronchoconstriction of the airways. The clients blood pressure and tenderness of chest wall do not require immediate follow-up.
Case Study Question 2 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 23-year-old male in the Emergency Department who is experiencing acute onset of shortness of breath.

For each potential finding, click to specify if the finding is a risk factor or not a risk factor for asthma.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The nurse should identify risk factors for asthma. Risk factors for asthma include family history, allergies, use of medications such as NSAIDS, betablockers and aspirin. With asthma non-cardio selective beta-blockers block the effects of beta 2 (lung) receptors. This blocks the ability of airways to expand for easier breathing. Smoking cigarettes, exposure to second-hand smoke, viral infections, a history of GERD, and being overweight are also risk factors. Edema and history of diabetes are not risk factors for asthma.

The nurse cares for a 23-year-old male in the Emergency Department who is experiencing acute onset of shortness of breath.

The labs and chest-Xray return.
Complete the sentence from the list of drop-down options.

Scoring Rule: Rationale
Rationale: The presenting assessment most suggests acute onset asthma evidenced by expiratory wheezing. Wheezing is a high-pitched whistling sound produced during breathing. It is a sign of bronchoconstriction, a narrowing of the airways of the lungs (bronchi) that impedes the flow of air to and from the lungs. Wheezing is often the first sign of asthma or an impending asthma attack. 


Case Study Question 4 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 23-year-old male in the Emergency Department who is experiencing acute onset of shortness of breath.

The client is diagnosed with onset acute asthma.
Which of the following interventions should the nurse anticipate including in the plan of care? Select all that apply


Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale:  Maintaining airway patency and preventing the occurrence of reversible complications are priorities in acute asthma care. The emergent plan of care involves giving short-acting Beta 2 agonist (Albuterol), cholinergic antagonist (Ipratropium), oxygen, and corticosteroids to reduce inflammation in the lungs. The nurse should raise the head of the bed to decrease the work of breathing and monitor the pulse oximeter readings. Beta-blockers, like labetalol, are not indicated because they block the effects of beta 2 (lung) receptors and the ability of airways to expand for easier breathing. NSAIDS and aspirin can induce bronchospasms. Tachypnea seen in asthma, increases insensible water loss from the lungs that can lead to dehydration. Increase work of breathing will decrease fluid intake by mouth. Oral fluids can be encouraged once breathing is no longer labored.


Case Study Question 5 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 23-year-old male in the Emergency Department who is experiencing acute onset of shortness of breath.
The nurse reviews the physician’s orders and considers needed teaching.
For each action, click to specify if the nurse should implement the action immediately, within the next hour, or before the end of the shift.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: When asthma is suspected, the emergent plan of care is giving short-acting Beta 2 agonist (Albuterol), cholinergic antagonist (Ipratropium), oxygen, and corticosteroids to reduce inflammation in the lungs. It is best to teach pursed lip breathing exercises when the patient is sitting upright and feeling relaxed. Pursed lip breathing is a simple technique for slowing down a person’s breathing and getting more air into their lungs. Ineffective inhaler use can lead to asthma exacerbation. Peak flow meters measure peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), a small device used to monitor lung function. Clients should be instructed to perform three peak flow meter readings regularly at least 2 to 4 times daily, when asthma symptoms are decreased or not present. Once the client is stabilized the nurse can instruct the client how to use albuterol rescue inhalers appropriately.

Case Study Question 6 of 6 
The nurse cares for a 23-year-old male in the Emergency Department who is experiencing acute onset of shortness of breath.

The nurse reassesses the client at 1330 after implementing the physician orders.
Complete the following sentence by choosing from the list of options. 

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The client’s shortness of breath has resolved, and the oxygen level has increased. Since the symptoms improved with corticosteroids, short-acting beta 2 agonist (Albuterol), Ipratropium and oxygen treatment, the nurse should now prepare the client for discharge to home.

Complete the diagram by dragging from the choices below to specify what condition the client is most likely experiencing, 2 actions the nurse should take to address that condition, and 2 parameters the nurse should monitor to assess the client’s progress.



Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The client’s condition has advanced to status asthmaticus. Status asthmaticus is a severe life-threatening acute episode of airway obstruction that does not respond well to standard treatment of bronchodilators and corticosteroid therapy. When status asthmaticus is suspected, high flow supplemental oxygen is delivered by partial or nonrebreather mask, and epinephrine is given to clients who have not rapidly responded to beta 2 agonist (albuterol). The nurse would monitor the oxygen saturation with a pulse oximetry during the initial treatment of status asthmaticus. When the oxygen levels are low in the blood, less oxygen goes to the brain, which can cause headaches and confusion as well. Increased work of breathing(respirations) may lead to muscle fatigue and life-threatening respiratory failure. If the condition is not reversed the client can develop a pneumothorax, cardiac or respiratory arrest. When the oxygen levels are low in the blood, it means less oxygen in the brain, which can cause not only headaches but confusion.

Key

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: The olanzapine must be stopped immediately as this is what caused the neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The hyperthermia must immediately be addressed by the addition of cooling measures. Starting the IV is critical to prevent dehydration from the fever and diaphoresis and to establish access for giving medications. A creatine kinase value will help guide treatment, but obtaining one is not as critical as implementing supportive care. Treating the muscle rigidity is lower priority that treating the high fever and  cannot be done until the IV is started. The urine must be monitored and documented but placing the foley is not the highest priority.

A 2- year- old male is brought by his father to an outpatient pediatric ambulatory clinic with a 2 day history of diarrhea. 

For each  factor click to indicate if the factor is consistent with mild, moderate, or severe dehydration.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
 Rationale: Non sunken eyes suggests dehydration is mild. Significantly  delayed cap refill > 4 seconds is consistent with severe dehydration.  Irritability, mild tachycardia, and decreased tears  are consistent with moderate dehydration. Given the child’s appropriate blood pressure, he is most likely experiencing moderate dehydration. If he were hypotensive that would be consistent with severe dehydration.

A 2- year- old male is brought by his father to an outpatient pediatric ambulatory clinic with a 2 day history of diarrhea. 

Complete the following sentence by choosing from the list of options.

Scoring Rule: Rationale
Rationale: Severe dehydration can be indicated by a capillary refill of greater than or equal to 4 seconds, but other assessments do not indicate severe dehydration. Eyes are typically sunken with moderate and severe dehydration. Client’s lethargy is indicative of moderate dehydration


Case Study Question 4 of 6 
A 2- year- old male is brought by his father to an outpatient pediatric ambulatory clinic with a 2 day history of diarrhea. 

The client is diagnosed with moderate dehydration. 
For each potential order, click to specify whether the order is anticipated or not anticipated to include in the plan of care.

Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: In moderate dehydration, IV fluids are not indicated, but oral rehydration would be the first intervention. IV Fluids are indicated in severe dehydration. Antipyretic should be administered to a febrile child who is symptomatic and at risk of worsening dehydration. Antidiarrheal agents are not the standard of care for a child with GI illness. The child may need a stool culture, but other diagnostic   testing of (Ultrasound or lab draw) is not needed if the child improves with oral fluids. Foley catheter is not indicated.

Case Study Question 5 of 6 
A 2- year- old male is brought by his father to an outpatient pediatric ambulatory clinic with a 2 day history of diarrhea. 

The nurse receives orders.
What should the nurse teach the client about the treatment plan? Select all that apply.

Fever can worsen dehydration due to increased metabolic rate*
If the client does not improve in one hour, he will need to transfer to the emergency department
Diarrhea can be easily transmitted via the fecal oral route*
The client should drink plenty of fruit juice
Provide small frequent amounts of oral rehydration*
Most diarrhea in children in the US is caused by eating contaminated food
The client should receive acetaminophen scheduled around the clock for 5 days
Family should report to the provider if the child becomes unarousable *

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Acetaminophen can cause hepatotoxicity if given more often that ordered or in too high of a dose and should be given as needed for fever, not scheduled over a time period. Oral rehydration should be given over 4 hours, and then the client status should be reevaluated. Admission to the emergency department is likely not warranted if the child can tolerate 4 hours of oral rehydration. A standard oral rehydration fluid should be used as it contains an appropriate ratio of essential electrolytes. Fruit juice can exacerbate diarrhea due to high sugar content. Diarrhea is often transmitted in children due to poor handwashing and not from contaminated food.



Case Study Question 6 of 6 
A 2- year -old male is brought by his parent to an outpatient pediatric ambulatory clinic with a 2 day history of diarrhea. 

The nurse reevaluates the client after implementing the treatment plan.
Which findings show the treatment plan has been effective? Select all that apply.
Blood pressure
Pain assessment
Temperature*
Mental status*
Urine output*
Stool output
Intake*

Scoring Rule: +/-
Rationale: Presence of urine, improved alertness, and decreased temperature are indicative that the oral rehydration and the antipyretic were effective. Blood pressure, pain and presence of diarrhea are unchanged.

Complete the diagram by dragging from the choices below to specify what condition the client is most likely experiencing, 2 actions the nurse should take to address that condition, and 2 parameters the nurse should monitor to assess the client’s progress.
Scoring Rule: 0/1
Rationale: The child is showing signs of moderate dehydration including decreased tears, decreased urine output, pale/dry oral mucosa and irritability. He is not demonstrating hypotension or signs of shock at this time. It is the standard of care to attempt oral rehydration in an outpatient setting for moderate dehydration, but the child’s perfusion and circulation should be monitored to ensure he does not decompensate. His intake should also be closely monitored to ensure he is retaining some of the rehydration offered.
