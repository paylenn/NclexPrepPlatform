NCLEX Administration website Introduction 1-3About the NCLEX® Administration website
The NCLEX Administration website allows users to process and manage 
records for candidates who register for and take the NCLEX. The website provides a secure, centralized location for Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body members to view candidate records and to quickly update them, set eligibility statuses and enter accommodations requests.Your Board of Nursing/Regu latory Body can see at a glance 
how many candidates are at the various stages of the examination process and can perform additional tasks such as generating reports 
based on candidate data.
Although Board of Nursing/Regulato ry Body members are the primary 
users of the website, other types of users also use the site to perform 
specific tasks. Only Boards of Nurs ing/Regulatory Body users, however, 
can edit candidate information.
Below is an overview of th e website’s main features:
Users  log in through NCSBN Passport (the portal through which you 
will access the NCLEX Administration Website) using their assigned 
usernames and passwords. When your user account was created by your administrator, you were assigned a set of permissions  for the 
NCLEX Administration Website, which allows you to perform tasks such as viewing reports, changing  eligibility status or editing 
candidate data.
Your jurisdiction’s profile  contains a variety of settings. 
For example, one profile setting determines whether candidates’ 
photos appear on reports. If you are assigned a specific permission, you can edit the profile; otherwise, you can view the profile’s settings.
The Flowchart page provides a high level view of the exam process 
and the number of registrations at each stage. If you’re assigned a specific permission, you can use this page to edit candidate registrations by their status.
Use the website’s search  features to locate candidates by their 
Name , Social Security Number (if applicable), NCLEX Candidate ID 
number , Date of Birth , or Phone Number . After selecting a 
candidate, you can view the candidate’s detailed information (including accommodations inform ation). If you’re assigned a 
specific permission, you can edit a selected candidate’s information.
Using the website, you can add and revoke accommodations requests you receive from candidates. You can also enter comments.
You can generate a variety of reports.
Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body members who mark eligibility status for candidates on a different system use batch files that they transfer to and from Pearson VUE. When batch processing is used, you send import files to Pearson VUE called jurisin files and receive 1-4Regulatory Body Guide version 14 .8.1 NCLEX Administration websiteexport files from Pearson VUE called jurisout files.
The Incidents page allows you to view a list of all Incident Reports 
associated with registrations in your jurisdiction. You can click 
an incident to view and print detailed information about it.
Use the Lists  page to view a listing of all educational programs, 
locate a testing center or view a listing of available exam readers 
and other assistive personnel. If  you’re assigned a specific 
permission, you can add to or edit the list of readers and assistive personnel.
Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body user tasks
The tasks you can perform are based on your assigned permissions.
We highly recommend that one or two people at your Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body jurisdiction be designated as administrators for your team with the Users  (may edit user logins and permissions) 
permission. These administra tors should be the only 
users allowed to edit other user accounts. We recommend that this be th e same person who manages 
the NCSBN Passport access for your jurisdiction. Additional information can be found in Chapter 7.
To perform tasks, click one of the links displayed in the NCLEX 
Administration website’s blue navigation bar that appears at the top of each page.
Typically, you’ll focus on setting candidates’ eligibility status, editing 
candidate information, requesting  accommodations and viewing exam 
results.
Listed below are the tasks you may perform on the website, depending 
on your assigned permissions.

candidate in your jurisdiction.
You can search in two ways:
Using the quick search method.
Using the Candidate Search page.
Important points about searching:To narrow your search, you can type entries in more than one 
search field, and the system w ill search for a candidate who 
matches ALL entries. For example, if you type the candidate’s name in the First Name  and Last Name  fields and the first three digits 
of his or her Social Security number in the SSN field (if applicable), 
the system will find candidates with the name you specified whose 
Social Security number (if provid ed) also begins with the three 
numbers you specified.
Searching is not case-sensitive.
When entering a Social Security number, including dashes is optional. Note that candidates can choose not to provide a Social Security number when they re gister, which means you won’t 
be able to locate those candidates using Social Security numbers. 
Social Security Numbers are not applicable to Canadian or international candidates.
If your search yields more resu lts than can be displayed on the 
page, a message asks you to enter more specific criteria to narrow your search.

Candidate Data
This chapter covers the following topics:
How registrations move through the exam process
Viewing and editing candidates by processing status
Working with candidate results
Viewing and changing individual candidate records33-2Regulatory Body Guide version 14 .8.1 NCLEX Administration websiteHow registrations move through the exam 
process
The Flowchart page shown below ill ustrates the flow of candidate 
registrations in a jurisdiction as th ey move through the NCLEX process. 
(This process is described in detail on the following pages.) Use the 
flowchart to view and edit candidates by their status.
This section describes how registrations move through the exam process.
Registrations are rece ived by Pearson VUE.
Candidates submit their registrations: by NCLEX Candidate website, 
or by calling NCLEX Candidate Services. When submitting registrations, candidates specify the jurisdiction in which they are seeking licensure/registration.
Display newly-received registrations by clicking the New 
Registrations  status at the top of  the diagram shown on 
the previous page. Typically, you change the status of new 
registrations to Awaiting Eligibility  to move them from the New 
Registrations inbox.
NCLEX Administration website Viewing and Changing Candidate Data 3-3Some candidates request accommodations.
In the process of registering,  candidates are instructed 
in the NCLEX Examination Candidate Bulletin  to request any 
accommodations they require as soon as possible (preferably before 
registering for the exam). Once you receive a candidate’s accommodations request, add the request(s) to the candidate’s registration using the NCLEX Administration website.
Mark the registrations as  eligible or denied.
Before a candidate can schedule an  appointment to take the NCLEX, 
the Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body to which the candidate has 
applied must mark the registration as eligible.
When you select an NCLEX registration to review, all data from 
the registration and the candidate’s testing history are available on the Candidate Details and Registration Details pages. If the candidate was ever denied eligibility, information about the denied registration and the denying Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body (if available) is displayed in the candidate’s exam history.
After reviewing a registration, mark it  as either eligible or ineligible 
(denied).
If you mark the registration as Eligible , Pearson VUE 
automatically generates and sends the candidate an ATT 
(Authorization to Test) email, which allows him or her to 
schedule an exam appointment. (The ATT email is sent.)
If you mark the registration as Denied, the Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body is responsibl e for notifying the candidate; 
Pearson VUE does not notify candidates that they have been denied eligibility. Denied candidates do not receive a refund if their registrations are marked ineligible. The candidate’s registration remains in the database as a denied registration.
Important points about marking regi strations as eligible or denied:
You can mark registrations with accommodations  as eligible 
any time after entering the accommodations requests. 
The candidate will not receive his or her ATT email (and cannot schedule an appointment) un til all pending accommodations 
requests have been granted or denied by NCSBN.
Board of Nursing/Regula tory Body users who manage their 
eligibility offline  export all registrations awaiting eligibility to a 
standard formatted file. After you mark candidate eligibility using your own system, upload the records to the NCLEX Administration website for importing into the Pearson VUE system.3-4Regulatory Body Guide version 14 .8.1 NCLEX Administration websiteCandidates schedule appointm ents and take their exams.
Candidates can schedule exam appointments on the NCLEX 
Candidate website or by calli ng NCLEX Candidate Services. 
They must take their exam with in the eligibility dates shown 
on their ATT email. (Eligibility dates are based on ATT settings 
in the Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body’s profile.)
If, for some reason, a candidate does not take the exam, he or she 
must start the registration process over again. You can view a list 
of candidates who did not take their exams by clicking the Exam 
Not Taken  status on the Flowchart page.
Exam results are processed and made available.
Typically, the candidate’s exam is quickly scored and his or her 
status is automatically changed to Result Available. You can view and print exam scores for candidates  with a Result Available status 
at any time.
Occasionally, Pearson VUE places a hold on a candidate’s exam 
results based on a set of defi ned rules. When this occurs, 
a designated person at Pearson VUE investigates the issue and, if necessary, consults with NCSBN. After the issue is resolved, Pearson VUE takes the necessary action, which may involve removing the hold or revoking the results.
Mark completed registrations as processed.
The Processed Registrations  status represents the last step 
in the registration process. After sending exam results 
to candidates, you can close the candidates’ registrations to move them to the Processed Registrations status. This step is not required, but doing so regularly prevents the Result Available list from growing increasingly longer.NCLEX Administration website Viewing and Changing Candidate Data 3-5Viewing and editing candidates by processing 
status
The Flowchart page provides a view of all active candidate registrations 
in your jurisdiction.
Use the Flowchart page to:
view the overall status of registrations in your jurisdiction
select candidates according to their status, and change statuses 
individually or as a group
select candidates according to their status, then change their detailed information individually
You must be assigned the RegStatus (may edit 
registration status) permission to change a candidate’s registration status, and the CandData  (may edit 
candidate data) permission to edit candidates’ information.

Use this page to change one or mo re candidate’s status to Eligible,

If you aren’t going to make an immediate eligibility decision, it’s a good idea for Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body users to change the status of new registrations to Awaiting Eligibility. Although that status does not have any effect on the registration, it does cause the registration to be moved to the Awaiting Eligibility area on the Flowchart page. If you don’t set eligibility and don’t set the status to Awaiting Eligibility, the registration will continue to be displayed on the New Registrations page.
Candidates can be assigned the New or Awaiting

Pearson VUE identifies ATTs and registrations that are no longer valid 
and separates them from other candidate records in the database. A software utility searches the data base each evening and flags expired 
registrations.
Expired ATTs
An ATT expires if a candidate was declared eligible to take an exam, but the ATT end date has passed.
An ATT remains valid until midnight  on the ATT end date. After that, 
the candidate cannot schedule an appointment.
If a candidate’s ATT expires, the registration is moved 
to the Expirations box on the Flow chart page on the Administration 
website.
If a candidate’s ATT expires, the Candidate website indicates this.
If a Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body uses batch processing and has asked to receive expired ATTs in the jurisout file, the jurisout file will contain a Service Order Ca ncel for expired ATTs. The Service 
Order Cancel Reason is 5 (Error/Registration Expired).
Expired registrations
According to NCSBN policy, candidate registrations expire if one year has passed since the registration was created, and the registration is still in the New or Awaiting Eligibility stage (meaning the candidate was never declared eligible to take an exam and was never denied eligibility).
Registrations remain valid until midnight on the 365th day after 
they are created. Candidates with expired registrations who want to take an exam must re-register, pay the examination fee again and be declared eligible by a Bo ard of Nursing/Regulatory Body.
The candidate registration confirmation letter informs candidates that registrations expire in 365 da ys. If a candidate’s registration 
expires, the Candidate website indicates why the registration expired.
If a candidate’s registration expires, the registration is moved to the Expirations box on the Flow chart page on the Administration 
website.
If a Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body uses batch processing and has asked to receive expired regist rations in the jurisout file, the

3-24Regulatory Body Guide version 14 .8.1 NCLEX Administration websiteWorking with candidate results
Once the candidate completes the ex am, the results are automatically 
scored at the testing center. They  are then sent to Pearson VUE 
for rescoring and verification. Once that process is complete, 
the results are posted to the NCLEX Administration website. Results may be available on the same day on which the exam was taken; however, Pearson VUE has 48 hours to  distribute results to the NCLEX 
Administration website.
You can view a candidate’s exam results in one of two ways:
By clicking the Result Available  status on the Fl owchart page and 
selecting a candidate from the list. With the appropriate permission, 
you can also print candidate results reports and mailing labels and generate a summary report from the Result Available page.
By searching for the candidate and clicking the Exam History  link 
at the bottom of the Candidate Details or the Registration Details page.
To display registrations for which the exam has been completed but the results have been placed on hold , see “Viewing registrations placed 
on hold for results”.
If your Member Board subscribes to the Quick Results service, candidates can receive an unofficial pass/fail result via the NCLEX Candidate website.
Regulatory Bodies do not subscribe to the Quick Results 
service.
After viewing and printing results, you can close candidates’ registrations, which changes their status from Result Available to Processed.
You must be assigned the RegStatus  (may edit 
registration status) permission to change a candidate’s registration status. 
 
NCLEX Administration website Viewing and Changing Candidate Data 3-25Printing results and closing registrations
As soon as a candidate’s exam is scored, the candidate’s registration 
status automatically changes from E ligible to Result Available. When 
a registration’s status is Result Available, you can view and print exam 
results. Printing results generates a Candidate Report for those who passed and a Candidate Performanc e Report for those who failed.
After you have completed your own exam results processing (for example, notifying candidates and mailing certificates), you can 
change the registrations’ status to Closed. This moves them to the Processed Registrations status, where they remain. Closing registrations keeps the Result Available list from growing too large, and ensures that the Result Available status contains new results only.
You can generate candidate reports in several ways:
On the Result Available  page, as described below. After selecting 
candidates, you can generate candidate reports for them, close 
their registrations, or generate candidate reports AND close their registrations at the same time.
Click the Generate Candidate Report  link on the Candidate 
Details page. Clicking this link generates a candidate report but does not close the candidate’s registration.

for whom you want to print results, then either generate the reports and close the registrations or gene rate the reports without changing 
registration status.3-26Regulatory Body Guide version 14 .8.1 NCLEX Administration websiteThe columns on this page display information about the candidate,

Resolved  appears if the registration has accommodations requests 
that were resolved.
In addition to the NCLEX exam, a second exam type 
known as NCLEX-R&C  may appear in the Exam  
column. NCLEX-R&C refers to a Review & Challenge exam, where a candidate who fails can question his or her results. After paying another fee, the candidate schedules an NCLEX-R&C exam, which shows the answers the candidate gave for items he or she answered incorrectly. Since a Review and Challenge exam is not scored, Taken  appears 
in the Result column instead of Pass or Fail. The Review & Challenge exams are only available to Member Boards. Regulatory Bodies do not offer Review & Challenge exams.

Accommodations
This chapter covers the following topics:
Accommodations process
Supported accommodations
Working with accommodations
Adding accommodations requests
Revoking accommodations
Viewing or editing the list of readers (assistive personnel)44-2Regulatory Body Guide version 14.8.1Accommodations process
This section describes the steps involved in the accommodations 
process and the tasks Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body users, NCSBN users and Pearson VUE Accommodations Coordinators perform.
It’s important  to enter the accommodations requests 
BEFORE a candidate’s status is set to Eligible, whenever possible. When a status is set to Eligible, an ATT email is automatically generated and sent to the candidate. However, if the record has any pending accommodations requests, an ATT email will not be sent until those requests are resolved. Although the system allows accommodations to be entered after a candidate has been made eligible, this may require unscheduling a candidate’s exam appointment. It also means the candidate will receive multiple ATT emails, which can be confusing.
A candidate contacts a Board of  Nursing/Regulatory Body to 
request accommodations.
Candidates who require special accommodations register for 
the NCLEX exam using standard procedures, but also submit an accommodations request in wr iting to the Board of Nursing/
Regulatory Body in the jurisdic tion in which they are seeking 
licensure/registration. Once the registration is entered in the 
system, the registration appear s on the NCLEX Administration 
website and is assigned the New Registration status.
The Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body adds the accommodations request to th e candidate’s registration.
When the Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body receives a candidate’s accommodations request, use the NCLEX Administration website to add the request(s) to the candidate’s registration. After candidate registrations are processed, they are displayed on the NCLEX Administration website and accommodations requests can then be entered. Select the accommod ation type, choose options or 
provide additional information (if required) and enter comments or recommendations to NCSBN.
The Accommodation Place Holder accommodation is revoked.
You MUST revoke this accommodation after entering a candidate’s 
accommodations request(s). (If the Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body doesn’t revoke it, the ATT email will not be sent to the candidate.) 
NCLEX Administration website Candidate Accommodations 4-3The Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body marks the candidate 
eligible.
The registration can be marked eligible any time after 
the accommodations request is added. The candidate will not 
receive his or her ATT email (and cannot schedule an appointment) until all pending accommodations re quests have been granted by 
NCSBN in the NCLEX Administration website.
An NCSBN user reviews the request.
Immediately after an accommodations request is saved, NCSBN can 
review the request on the NCLEX Ad ministration website, including 
the Board of Nursing’s/Regulato ry Body’s recommendations and 
comments. NCSBN may work with the Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body to reach a mutually agreeabl e decision regarding the request.
NCSBN then either:
Grants  the request in the NCLE X Administration website.
Denies  the request: If NCSBN determines the accommodations 
request should not be granted, they will contact the Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body to deny the request in the website. It 
is the Board of Nursing’s/Regulatory Body’s responsibility to inform the candidate that his or her accommodations request 
has been denied. Information about which accommodations have been granted or denied does  not appear in the candidate’s 
ATT email.
Replaces the accommodation: If a Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body and NCSBN determine that  an alternate accommodation 
should be granted rather than th e one originally requested, the 
original request must be revoked and a new request should be entered. It is the Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body’s responsibility to inform the candidate that his or her accommodations request has been replaced.
The ATT (Authorization to Test) email is sent to the candidate.
Once NCSBN has granted all a ccommodations requests for a 
particular registration and the registration is marked eligible, the 
ATT email is generated and sent. (If a registration has pending accommodations requests, the ATT email cannot be sent and the exam cannot be scheduled.) The ATT email specifies that 
candidates with granted accommodations must schedule an appointment by calling the Pearson VUE Accommodations Coordinator at NCLEX Candidate Services. (The candidate will automatically be prevented from scheduling via the NCLEX 
Candidate website.)4-4Regulatory Body Guide version 14.8.1The candidate schedules an appointment with the Pearson 
VUE Accommodations Coordinator.
The Pearson VUE Accommodations Coordinator schedules 
appointments for all NCLEX registrations that have accommodations. The coordinator is trained to handle special condition testing situations in cluding scheduling multiple-day 
appointments. If necessary, he or she also works with the testing 
center the candidate chooses to ensure that the accommodation is set up properly before the candidate arrives for the exam.
Some accommodations require special personnel to assist 
the candidate during exam delive ry. For example, sight-impaired 
candidates may require a reader to assist them during the exam. Pearson VUE is responsible for scheduling personnel according to guidelines provided by Boards of Nursing/Regulatory Bodies and NCSBN. A Pearson VUE Accommodations Coordinator sends assistive personnel a packet of pertinent information, including the Assistive Personnel Agreement and a confirmation email.
The candidate takes the NCLEX exam with accommodations.
The test administrator checks th e center’s exam schedule in the 
Pearson VUE Testing System to find out which candidates have 
approved accommodations. Accommodations for extra time and adjustable font size and contrast are built into the exam delivery 
software, and the administrator doesn’t need to intervene. The Pearson VUE Accommodations Coordinator will have already informed the administrator abou t any nonstandard accommodation 
and provided instructions if necessary. If an assistive person was approved for the candidate, the test administrator follows a standard procedure for checking in the person.
When the test administrator starts the exam for the candidate, 
the software displays a list of the accommodations for which the candidate has been approved , as an additional reminder.
Test administrators are not permitted to rescind or change accommodations for NCLEX exams at the testing center.
Special cases
This section describes how special accommodations cases are handled.
If there are accommodations changes after an appointment has been scheduled, the Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body must contact NCSBN, who will contact the Pearson VUE Accommodations Coordinator. This is because the coordinator may have already made arrangements for a granted accommodation or may need 
to make arrangements for a new or changed accommodation. 
 
NCLEX Administration website Candidate Accommodations 4-5A candidate contacts a Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body 
and says he or she no longer requires a granted 
accommodation, or the Board of  Nursing/Regulatory Body 
decides that a granted accommodation should be denied instead.
If an appointment has not been scheduled , the Board of 
Nursing/Regulatory Body or an  NCSBN user can revoke the 
accommodation on the NCLE X Administration website 
(regardless of whether or not the request has already been granted).
If an appointment has already been scheduled , the Board of 
Nursing/Regulatory Body must contact NCSBN, who must ask the Pearson VUE Accommodations Coordinator to revoke the accommodation in the system. If  the accommodation extended 
the candidate’s testing time, the appointment reverts to a normal exam time.
A candidate requests an acco mmodation or accommodation 
change after being made eligib le, or the Board of Nursing/
Regulatory Body decides that a denied accommodation should be granted instead.
The Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body or NCSBN may need to add 
an accommodations request after the ATT email has been sent. 
For example, a candidate may request an accommodation after the Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body  has already made him or her 
eligible.
If the ATT email has been sent but the appointment has not yet been scheduled , you can enter the request for the new 
accommodation, which automatically prevents the candidate from scheduling an appointment.
If the candidate has already scheduled the exam , the Board of 
Nursing/Regulatory Body cannot add or change 
accommodations via the NCLEX Administration website. The Board of Nursing/Regulatory Bo dy must contact NCSBN, who 
contacts the Pearson VUE Accommodations Coordinator to unschedule the appointment. (Pearson VUE will send an email to the candidate, notifying him or her that the appointment has been unscheduled.) The Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body can 
then enter the new accommodat ions request and NCSBN can 
grant the request in the website. Pearson VUE sends a new ATT email to the candidate, and the candidate can then reschedule 
his or her appointment.
In both of the above cases, eligibility dates are adjusted 
in the updated ATT email so that the candidate receives the same amount of time as in the original ATT email.4-6Regulatory Body Guide version 14.8.1Batch Processing Jurisin files
When a Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body uses batch processing 
(jurisin files), accommodations are handled in a slightly different way than when they do not use batch processing. This section describes the steps involved in the accommodations process for batch processing and the tasks Board of Nursing/Regulato ry Body users, NCSBN users and 
Pearson VUE Accommodations Coordinators perform.
Your Board of Nursing/Regula tory Body sets the Special 
Conditions flag in the ju risin.dat file to True.
Setting this flag in the jurisin file automatically sets 
the accommodations placeholder named Accommodation Place 
Holder . (If you don’t do this and then set a registration to Eligible, 
the ATT email will be sent without the accommodations information as noted above once the candidate registers with Pearson VUE for the NCLEX.)
Important points about accommodations
How does the Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body know when NCSBN has granted or denied a request?
As stated in the NCSBN’s NCLEX® Administration Manual, NCSBN 
may work with Boards of Nursing/Regulatory Bodies to make accommodations decisions. Use one of these methods to check that accommodations have been resolved and an ATT email has been sent to a candidate:
Search for the candidate’s record on the NCLEX Administration website. (Regulatory Bodies do  not require SSN.) When the 
record is found, click the ca ndidate’s exam type in the Exam  
column to display the Registration Details page. The status of each requested accommodation is shown in the Basic Information section of the page. If there are dates entered in the ATT Start  and ATT End  fields (in the Authorization 
Information section), then an AT T email has been sent to the 
candidate.
If the candidate has already been made Eligible, click 
the Flowchart  link and click the Eligible  status on the diagram. 
In the list of candidates that appears, the ATT Sent column lists the date on which the ATT email was sent to the candidate, and the Notes column indicates whether or not all accommodations have been resolved for a registration.NCLEX Administration website Candidate Accommodations 4-7How does a candidate know abou t the status of his or her 
accommodations requests?
The Board of Nursing/Regulatory Bo dy is responsible for informing 
candidates of the status of their accommodations requests. This 
includes informing them when re quests are denied, revoked or 
replaced.
If a candidate calls to check on an accommodation’s status, locate 
the record on the NCLEX Administra tion website by either searching 
for the candidate or clicking the appropriate registration status on the Flowchart page and then clicking the candidate’s exam type in the Exam  column. The Registration Details page displays 
the current status of all accommodation requests in the Basic Information section as noted above.
When does Pearson VUE send candidates the ATT emails?
ATT emails are automatically sent to candidates when BOTH of 
the following conditions are true:
The candidate’s registration status is set to Eligible.
AND
The candidate’s registration contains no accommodations requests OR all accommodations requests have been resolved 
(either granted or denied in the website) by NCSBN.
This means that if a candidate’s st atus is set to Eligible before 
entering accommodations requests, the candidate will receive one 
ATT email after eligibility is granted and another ATT email after NCSBN resolves the accommodations requests. To avoid this, enter accommodations information before granting eligibility whenever possible; the candidate will then receive only one ATT email, after NCSBN resolves the requests.
What if a Board of Nursing/Re gulatory Body or a candidate 
wants to make changes to accommodations after the 
candidate has received an ATT email?
The process depends on the kind of  a change that is required and 
whether or not the candidate ha s already scheduled an exam 
appointment.
What to tell candidates that have received multiple ATT 
emails?
If a candidate calls and says he or she has received multiple ATT 
emails, tell the candidate to alwa ys use the email received most 
recently.4-8Regulatory Body Guide version 14.8.1How can candidates with acco mmodations schedule exam 
appointments?
Like other candidates, candid ates who have been granted 
accommodations can schedule exam  appointments only after 
receiving an ATT email. However, candidates with accommodations 
can schedule only by calling NCLEX Candidate Services and asking 
to speak with the Pearson VUE Accommodations Coordinator. 
Candidates with accommodations must also reschedule or unschedule appointments through the Coordinator.
Note that a candidate cannot schedu le an exam appointment if his 
or her registration has unresolved accommodations requests even if 
he or she has already received an ATT email . If a request is added 
after making a candidate eligible , and the candidate has already 
received an ATT email, he or sh e will not be able to schedule 
an appointment until NCSBN grants  or denies the new request in 
the website.
Can a candidate change his or her mind about accommodations after arriving at the testing center?
Candidates who have been granted accommodations are required 
to test with those accommodations, unless they have the accommodations revoked in advance. The test administrator and the staff at NCLEX Candidate Se rvices cannot revoke or change 
accommodations requests without approval from NCSBN. The candidate can either test wi th the accommodations or choose 
not to test (and then register and repay the examination fee).
Likewise, a candidate cannot arrive at the testing center and expect 
to receive accommodations that were not requested and granted 
in advance. The candidate can either test without 
the accommodations or choose not to  test (and then register and 
repay the examination fee).
What happens if a candidate arrives for an exam and 
the accommodations are not prepared?
If a candidate arrives at a testing center and the accommodations 
are not ready or cannot be provided, the test administrator will contact the Pearson VUE Accommodations Coordinator to verify that the accommodations were requested and granted. The coordinator will work with the testing center to try to arrange the accommodations; if arrangemen ts cannot be made within 30 
minutes, the candidate can re schedule the exam appointment
with the Pearson VUE Accommodations Coordinator at no additional cost. An Incident Report will be filed to document why the accommodations were not provided to the candidate.NCLEX Administration website Candidate Accommodations 4-9Supported accommodations
NCLEX candidates can request and be granted the accommodations 
listed in this section.
Temporary Test Centers may not be able to accommodate all accommodations in the list.
Additional testing time
The standard NCLEX-RN exam involves six hours of testing time, while the standard NCLEX-PN exam involves five hours. In both exams, candidates are granted two schedu led breaks that are built into
the exam software: an optional brea k two hours after the exam begins 
and an optional break 3.5 hours after the exam begins. In addition, candidates can take an unlimited number of unscheduled breaks. For each of these, the amount of brea k time that is taken is subtracted 
from the total available testing time. In other words, for every minute of break time a candidate takes, he or she loses that amount of testing time.
The exam time and break times are ca lculated from the time at which 
the candidate is seated for the exam and the test administrator 
launches the exam on the candidate’s workstation. Candidates must 
leave the testing room for all breaks . After a break, the administrator 
must escort each candidate to hi s or her workstation and resume 
the exam.
Scheduled and unscheduled brea ks differ as described below.
Scheduled  breaks are programmed in the system so that 
the candidate is offered a break at a time predetermined by NCSBN. 
When the time for a break arrives, a message appears on the candidate’s computer screen. The candidate clicks Yes to take 
the break or No to decline the break and continue with the exam. 
If the candidate clicks Yes, the exam is put into break mode until 
the administrator resumes it for the candidate. The exam clock 
is NOT stopped during these breaks.
Unscheduled  breaks are not automatic. If a candidate wants to take

the original request must be revoked and a new request must be added.
The Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body cannot use the NCLEX 
Administration website to revoke granted accommodations if the candidate has already scheduled an appointment. The Board of 
Nursing/Regulatory Body will need to contact NCSBN, who will ask the Pearson VUE Accommodations Coordinator to revoke the accommodation. This is so the Coordinator is aware of any arrangements that he or she may ne ed to cancel (such as assistive 
personnel or special equipment).
After an accommodation has been revoked, the status cannot be 
changed. A new accommodation  request must be entered.

About reports
Report descriptions and examples55-2Regulatory Body Guide version 14 .8.1 NCLEX Administration websiteAbout reports
The reporting portal allows Boards of Nursing/Regulatory Bodies to 
view operational reports, quarterly reports and access Candidate 
Performance Reports. 
Operational ReportsThere are several operational reports that you may run related to 
candidates who have registered fo r the NCLEX in your jurisdiction.
Quarterly Reports
Each quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct) a set of reports are made available 
that provide data on educationa l program information for your 
jurisdiction. NCSBN will notify you when these reports are ready 
for you to view.
Candidate Performance ReportsYour jurisdiction may choose to provide candidates with information 
about the exam they have taken. These are optional reports that 
you may make available to the cand idate. Some jurisdictions print 
the Candidate Performance Reports for candidates who have failed so that they can review the diagnostic information.
The reporting portal can be accesse d through the Reports link in the 
blue navigation bar at the top of the NCLEX Administration web page. The Boards of Nursing/Regulatory Bo dies are the only entities with 
access to the reporting portal. It is through this portal that Boards of Nursing/Regulatory Bodies can access quarterly reports detailing candidate results listed by education programs in their jurisdiction.
If you have questions about reports, please use the online-help within th e reporting system. The 
reporting portal can be accessed through the Reports  
link in the blue navigation bar at the top of the NCLEX 
Administration web page.
You must have the MBReports  (may run Member Board 
reports) permission to request and view reports for your 
jurisdiction. Only Boards of  Nursing/Regulatory Bodies 
can access quarterly reports detailing candidate results listed by education programs by jurisdiction.
In addition to the information availa ble to you in the reporting portal, 
Candidate Reports (score reports) are also available via the NCLEX Admin website. See below for further details.

NCLEX Administration website Reports 5-3Report descriptions and examples
This section provides details on the Candidate Report that is available 
through the NCLEX administration website.
Candidate Report
The Candidate Report is a letter indicating whether or not a candidate passed an NCLEX exam. If the candidat e failed, the report also includes 
information to help candidates inte rpret their performance and prepare 
for retaking the exam. Boards of  Nursing/Regulatory Bodies are 
responsible for sending these letters to candidates who take the exam. This report is delivered in PDF format.
This report can be generated in the following ways:
To select specific candidates for whom you want to print results 
reports, display the Result Available  page or the On Hold for 
Results  page. After you submit the request from one of those 
pages, your report request will appear on the Requests  page 
like any other report.
On the Registration Details page, click the Generate Candidate 
Report  link that appears for registra tions with a Result Available 
status. You must be assigned the RegStatus  (may edit registration 
status) permission.
It is the Board of Nursing’s/Regulatory Body’s responsibility to send a Candidate Report to candidates. It is also the Board of Nursing’s/Regulatory Body’s responsibility to send the Candidate Performance Report to candidates who did not pass the exam.
The Candidate Report may or may not show a candidate’s photo. 
Whether the candidate’s photo is displayed depends on a setting in the jurisdiction’s profile called Use Candidate Photo on 
Reports .

This chapter covers the following topics:
Incident overview
Viewing Incident Reports for candidate registrations
Incident overview
Use the Incidents area of the NCLE X Administration website to view 
a list of incidents associated with re gistrations in your jurisdiction, and 
to view details about selected incidents.
At Pearson VUE, Incident Reports are filed using an online system. 
This system allows testing centers to file reports about any problems 
or issues related to a specific candidate registration. For example, if a power outage interrupted a candidate’s exam, a candidate arrived without proper identification or a candidate was suspected of misconduct, the test administrator would file an Incident Report. (Other Pearson VUE users, such as NCLEX Candidate Services representatives and VSS personnel, can also file reports.) In some 
cases, such as when there is su spected cheating, exam results are 
automatically put on hold when an Incident Report is filed against 
a candidate’s registration. The incident can then be investigated before results are released to the candidate. For more information on the reasons for results being put on  hold, refer to the Member Board 
Manual (MBM) or the NCLEX Administration Manual (NAM).
The test administrator or other staff person provides as much 
information as possible about the in cident, specifies which candidates 
were involved and attaches support ing files, if applicable. When 
the Incident Report is submitted, the system automatically assigns a priority level (urgent, high, medium or low) and routes it to the appropriate person at Pearson VU E for further action. This person 
consults NCSBN and the responsible Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body when necessary. Each person who is involved with addressing the issue can enter notes about the issue and the investigation until the 66-2Regulatory Body Guide version 14 .8.1 NCLEX Administration websiteinvestigation is complete. If necessary, an incident can be escalated to 
someone at a higher level in the Pearson VUE organization. When the 
issue has been resolved, the Incident Report is closed.

RN Board  and/or PN Board:  Select the fields that correspond 
to the types of exams your jurisdiction offers. For example, if your jurisdiction offers NCLEX-RN and NCLEX-PN exams, check both the RN Boar d and PN Board boxes.
CGFNS Required:  Select this option if your jurisdiction requires 
non-US educated candidates to  provide a CGFNS certification 
number when registering for the NCLEX exam. CGFNS refers to The Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools. This agency provides credentialing services for foreign-educated 
nurses, along with a certification program designed to predict success on the NCLEX-RN exam. (This field currently has no effect on candidate registration.)
Allow Data Sharing:  Select this option to allow certain 
candidate data to be shared between your jurisdiction and others. (Typically, you can see candidate data for your own jurisdiction only.) For example, the Education Program Summary Report lists registration  and identification information 
for candidates who graduated from an educational program in your jurisdiction. If a candidate applied for licensure in another jurisdiction whose Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body does not have data sharing enabled, dashes are displayed instead of the candidate’s name on the report.
This field needs to be se t according to your state 
mandates. Changing this field’s setting affects the information displayed in reports.
Allow Early Results Release:  If this option is selected, 
candidates in your jurisdiction can pay to receive their unofficial exam results before receiving th e official results from your 
Board of Nursing/Regulatory Body . Candidates can receive their 
results (a pass/fail result only) by visiting the NCLEX Candidate website. Note:  This option is not applicable to Canadian 
Regulatory Bodies.
Allow Other Readers:  NCSBN permits Pearson VUE to use 
a vendor to provide assistive personnel. As a result, Allow Other Readers is not a field that you will need to configure.
Use Candidate Photo On Reports:  Select this option to 
specify whether your Board of Nu rsing/Regulatory Body allows 
candidates’ photos to be included on candidate result reports, such as the Candidate Report and the Candidate Performance 
Report. Deselecting the field prev ents the photo from appearing

this option to generate mailing labels along with the CPR report.
Generate double-sided Diagnostic Reports:  Select this 
option to include a blank page if a candidate report is only a single page and multiple candid ate reports are generated in a 
single file. This ensures each candidate report prints as a separate document.
Retake Delay (in Days):  Users can determine the number of 
days candidates must wait between exam sessions.
Per the NCSBN retake policy, Board or Nursing/Regulatory Bodies must select a minimum or 45 days for the retake delay.
Delay in ATT Dates (in Days):  In this field, Board of Nursing/
Regulatory Body users specify th e number of days after the ATT 
(Authorization to Test) email is sent before the candidate’s eligibility period begins. Once a candidate is declared eligible, he or she receives the ATT email.
Since the ATT emails are sent to candidates, this should be set to zero (0) so candidates can schedule their exam immediately upon receipt of their ATT email.
Days ATT is Valid: Specify the number of days after 
a candidate is declared eligible within which the candidate must take the exam. Candidates must schedule AND take the exam during their ATT validity period.
